# Non-overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Strategy 
- we count the number of overlaps 
- in case a overlap is found we need to decide which one of the conflicting intervals will be taken forward 
- in case of a overlap; we take teh one which ends earlier; this way we minimize the risk of further conflicts down the line
- if we take teh one which ends later, we are at risk of conflicts / overlaps in with teh future intervals

- Sort the `intervals` by `start time`
- we take the first interval (i.e interval 0 from the list) from the list and call it `tempInterval`
- we loop on teh remaining intervals starting from index 1; 
  - we call each interval `current Interval` 
  - if they are ovelapping 
     - we increment the counter
     - we need to remove one of teh overlapping interval and keep one
     - we shall keep the interval which ends early ; this way we minimize teh risk of overlapping further down the line
  - if they are not overlapping 
     - proceed to the next interval      
- finaly return the count
