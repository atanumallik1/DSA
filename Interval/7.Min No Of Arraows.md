# Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact `y-coordinates` of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive `y-direction`) from different points along the `x-axis`. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is burst by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Example 1:

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

## Leetcode
- https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/


## Strategy 
1. Sort based on `Start time` 
2. Take out the first interval and assign its end to `previousEnd`
3. Loop through all the **remaining** intervals 
4.   if `previousEnd` > `currentStart` ; there is an overlap.
   - The same arrow will now burst 2 beloons ; we do **not** increase the arrow count 
   - we need to readjust the `previousEnd`
   - `previousEnd` will point to the right most time where both the beloons are present ; 
      
      ````java
                previousEnd = Math.min(previousEnd,currentEnd );
				continue;
       ````
5. If there is no overlap ; then we need an extra arrow here 
6. We recalculate the `previousEnd`
   ````java
    // we take currentEnd as previousEnd
			previousEnd= currentEnd;
