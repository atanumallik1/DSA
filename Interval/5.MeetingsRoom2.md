## Explanation 
- Neetcode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdzJmTCVyJU 


## Strategy
- This is a very smart approach 
- The problem is explained in the picture 
  - we see that there are 2 points where we need 2 meeting rooms 
  - so the minimum no of meeting rooms needed is 2

### Algo
- we want to traverse each point in teh time axis in the `ascending order` ; based on whether the time indicates a `start` or an `end` of meeting we need to `increment` or `decrement` the of of rooms required. 
- we shall prepare 2 arrays , in ascending order
  - `start_time_array`  : contains all meeting start time in ascending order
  - `end_time_array`   : contains all meeting end time in ascending order 
- we shall have 2 pointer , in ascending order
  - `start_time_pointer`  : points at the first element of the array
  - `end_time_pointer`   : points at the first element of the array

- loop until we finish both the arrays 
  -   if data at `start_time_pointer` < if data at `end_time_pointer` ;    this marks teh start of a meeting
     -   we move the `start_time_pointer` to point to the next element in the `start_time_array`
     -   increment the no of rooms 
 -   if data at `start_time_pointer` > if data at `end_time_pointer` ;  this marks teh end of a meeting
     -   we move the `end_time_pointer` to point to the next element in the `end_time_array` 
     -   decrement the no of rooms 
- we return the max value for no of meeting rooms 
- here is a dry run
