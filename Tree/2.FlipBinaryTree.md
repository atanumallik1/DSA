## Leetcode

## Strategy 
- We want to do a DFS and a Post Order traversal 

- First set the Base condition 
````java
       //BAse condition 
        if(root == null )
            return null;
````
- Do DFS for Left and Right Subtree 
````
        TreeNode left = invertTree(root.left);
        TreeNode right = invertTree(root.right);
````
- Once Left and Right Subtree is prcessed process the curresnt node by interchanging their pointers 
````java
        root.left = right;
        root.right = left;
        
````

## Code 
````java
public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        //BAse condition 
        if(root == null )
            return null;
        
        TreeNode left = invertTree(root.left);
        TreeNode right = invertTree(root.right);
        
        root.left = right;
        root.right = left;
        
        return root; 
        
    }
