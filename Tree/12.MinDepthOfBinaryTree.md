# Min Depth of Bin tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

- It is DFS
````java
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)
            return 0 ;
        
        int leftDepth = minDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = minDepth(root.right);
        if(root.left != null && root.right != null)
          return Math.min(leftDepth,rightDepth) +1 ;
        else 
              return Math.max(leftDepth,rightDepth) +1 ;
        
    }
}

some discussion from Leetcod Forum

>BFS is much better here, rather than a DFS approach.
Sure, the solution here is short in terms of lines of code and looks nice, but it's far from optimal.
If you have a tree where say the root's left subtree has a depth of 500 and the right subtree has a depth of 1, the code is going to traverse all the way down the 500 left subtree first before finally traversing the right subtree with a measly depth of 1 and figuring out "d'oh!" that's the min depth.
With BFS, instead of traversing 501 nodes to figure out the min depth, you could've just traversed two. Now imagine if the left subtree comprised of tens of thousands of nodes ..


````java
/** Solution 1: DFS 
 * Key point: 
 * if a node only has one child -> MUST return the depth of the side with child, i.e. MAX(left, right) + 1
 * if a node has two children on both side -> return min depth of two sides, i.e. MIN(left, right) + 1
 * */
public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return 0;
    }

    int left = minDepth(root.left);
    int right = minDepth(root.right);
    if (left == 0 || right == 0) {
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
    else {
        return Math.min(left, right) + 1;
    }
}


/** Solution 2: BFS level order traversal */
public int minDepth2(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);
    int level = 1;
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int size = queue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            TreeNode curNode = queue.poll();
            if (curNode.left == null && curNode.right == null) {
                return level;
            }
            if (curNode.left != null) {
                queue.offer(curNode.left);
            }
            if (curNode.right != null) {
                queue.offer(curNode.right);
            }
