# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Strategy 

 - Given Array is sorted , we can create a binary tree like the below one . But it is not valid since it will create a Skewed Tree , we need to create a height balanced Tree .<br>

 - We need to create a height balanced tree  , this is possible if we find the middle element and distribute on one element from teh remaing array in  both the sides . 
 - In every iteration we find the `middle` of the array and set it as `root`. This way we can construct the tree like the below one....

 - `Recursion` to rescue us , we set the `root` node an we dive into recursive calls to construct the `left` and `right` subtree. The recusrsion function to have the following signature 
 ````java
 	TreeNode buildTree(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
  ...
  }
 ````
 -  Base Case  : When `end` pointer crosses the `start` pointer that means we are trying to create a `null` node. This happe
 ````java
 if (start > end)
			return null; 
 ````
 -  Single element  : When `start` and `end` pointer are same , it means we are at a `leaf` node; we can create a single node and no need to traverse to right or left .. 
 ````java
 if (start == end)
			return new TreeNode(nums[start]);
 ````

 - for the remaing nodes we fire recusrion 
 ````java
  int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
		TreeNode current = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
  
  current.left = buildTree(nums, start, mid - 1);
		current.right = buildTree(nums, mid + 1, end);
		return current;
 ````
 
## Code
````java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0)
            return null;
        
        return buildTree(nums, 0, nums.length -1) ;
        
    }
    
   TreeNode buildTree(int[] nums , int start, int end){
       if(start > end)
           return null; 
       if(start == end )
           return new TreeNode(nums[start]);
       
       
       int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
       TreeNode current = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
       
       current.left = buildTree(nums , start , mid-1);
       current.right = buildTree(nums , mid+1 , end);
       return current;
       
   }
}
