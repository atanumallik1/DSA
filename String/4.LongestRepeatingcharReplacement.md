# Longest Repeating Character Replacement 
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

Example 1:
````
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
````
Example 2:
````
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

## Explanation 
- Neetcode  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqXU1UyA8pk

## Strategy
 -   The maximum number of replacable character is `K`
 -   We want to traverse the string chacter by character and compte a frequency map ; in this map we want to identify 
        -   teh chacater with `Maximum` frequency
        -   sum of all other frequencies say `sumOflessFreqChars`.

        - Since we are allowed to make `k` replacements ; we replace `sumOflessFreqChars` characters to get a string of length `sumOflessFreqChars + Maximum`. This way we achieve maximum length with minimul replacement.. however only `K` replacemenst are allowed. Thsi means `sumOflessFreqChars` should be 
        `sumOflessFreqChars <= k`

        - `method chekState(Map<Character, Integer> frequencyMap, int k)` does this only.
- we tarverse teh array and with every move we check the validity condition 
- the moment it is invalid , we remove teh cracter from the `left` until the state is valis again
## Code
````java

 public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {

		int left = 0;
		int right;
		int maxLength = 0;
		Map<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap();

		for (right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
			frequencyMap.put(s.charAt(right), frequencyMap.getOrDefault(s.charAt(right), 0) + 1);
			// Check if the state is good
			if (chekState(frequencyMap, k))
				maxLength = maxLength > (right - left + 1) ? maxLength : right - left + 1;

			else {
				//When the new character not be accepted 
				// Remove them until we find a valid state 
				while(!chekState(frequencyMap, k)) {
					  char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
					  frequencyMap.put(leftChar, frequencyMap.get(leftChar)- 1);
					  left++;
				}

			}

		}

		return maxLength;

	}

	public boolean chekState(Map<Character, Integer> frequencyMap, int k) {
        // Thsi methd checks if the sum of non most frequent characters are less tahn an equal to K
    

		int sumOflessFreqChars = 0;
		int maxFreq = 0;

		for (int val : frequencyMap.values()) {
			maxFreq = maxFreq < val ? val : maxFreq;
			sumOflessFreqChars += val;
		}

		// What is length of non max characters ??
		sumOflessFreqChars = sumOflessFreqChars - maxFreq;
		if (sumOflessFreqChars <= k)
			return true;

		else
			return false;
