#  Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:
````
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
````
Example 2:
````
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
````
Example 3:
````
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
`````

## Code
### Approach 1
- The following code is very claver in its approach 
- it eleminates much of the duplicate code

- Few points to nore 
  - `Frequency Map` of type `int[] `
    - we are capturing the frequency of each character in an int array 
    - thsi array we want to use as `Hash Key`.
    - We can not use an array as a hash key `directly`  
    - We need to create a `string` from the `int[]` and then use the `string` as the hash key/
    - here we face a challenge , since there is no constructor in `String` which allows creation of string from `int[]`, we need to use thsi code 
     ````java
        int[] frequencyHash = new int[26];
     	String hashKey =  Arrays.toString(frequencyHash);
     ````
    - 

````java

     Map<String, List<String>> frequencyMap = new HashMap<String, List<String>>();
		List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<List<String>>();

		for (String word : strs) {

			int[] frequencyHash = new int[26];

			for (char letter : word.toCharArray())
				frequencyHash[letter - 'a']++;

            // Workaround to convert int array to string. 
			String hashKey =  Arrays.toString(frequencyHash);
            //Cache miss case : claver soln
			if (frequencyMap.get(hashKey) == null) {
				frequencyMap.put(hashKey, new ArrayList<>());
			}

			frequencyMap.get(hashKey).add(word);

		}

		result.addAll(frequencyMap.values());
		return result;
