# Problem Statement   

Sort an Array using QuickSort 

# Analogy to Remember the Sorting Algo 
Think about your school days, your teacher wants all 20 students to be sorted by their heights. 
If the teacher controlls everything and then , one by one he sorts the students that will take time. 

but if we do the following .....

A student (pivot) sends all other students with **smaller** heights **before** him and all other students with **greater** hights **after** him..

Then every student repeats it ... this will be **quicker**. This is quick sort.

# Strategy
The Quick Sort algo is based on `Partitioning` and `Recursion` 

## The first code 
1. We can start with a code block like 
````java
// Block 1: starting point
int a[] = new int [20] ;
void quicksort(a){
 // do something
}
````
## Recursion 
1. When we talk about quick sort , we think about __partitioning__ and then __sorting the individual parts__ ... so it is of pattern divide and conquer.. 
2. When we talk about sorting a part , we need to think about `start` and `end` of subarray ...  so we need to create additional methods to be capable of sorting partially 

````java
// Block 2: method which can sort partially 
 void quicksort(int a[] , int start , int end){
 // do something
}
````
3. `Partitioing` is a process during which an element ( called the `Pivot`) is placed at the right index ...  this is great for our recursion... we can recursively sort the elements `before` the pivot and `after` the pivot

so teh above code block change like this 

````java
// Block 2: method which can sort partially 
 void quicksort(int a[] , int start , int end){
   // do a partition of the ewhole array, the pivot element is correctly placed ar the end of partitioning process
   int pivot = partition(a, start, end);
   // Recursively sort the left sub array
   quicksort(a, start , pivot -1);
   // Recursively sort the right sub array
   quicksort(a, pivit+1 , end);
}
````

4. A recursion is not complete without the base condition.. in this case teh base condition is when there is only one element or no element
````java
// Block 2: method which can sort partially 
 void quicksort(int a[] , int start , int end){
   // base condition : when there is only one or no element 
   if(star>=end)
     return ;
   
   // do a partition of the ewhole array, the pivot element is correctly placed ar the end of partitioning process
   int pivot = partition(a, start, end);
   // Recursively sort the left sub array
   quicksort(a, start , pivot -1);
   // Recursively sort the right sub array
   quicksort(a, pivit+1 , end);
}
````

now the code in `Block1` changes to 
````java
// Block 1: starting point
int a[] = new int [20] ;
void quicksort(a){
  quicksort(int a[], 0, a.length-1);
}
````

## Partitioning 
There are 2 important parts in partitioning , `Pivot` selection and `Processing` 
### Pivot selection 
For now we select the left most element of the array as `Pivot`

### Processing  
1. `pointers`: We want 2 pointers pointing the `left` and `right` element of the array.  
2. `implicit Pivot`: `left` pointer points to the pivot element, this element will be correctly positioned at teh end of teh loop. 
3. In Processing we want to move all elements `smaller than the pivot` to the `left` and all emements `greater than the pivot` to the `right` . elements between `left` and `right` (both included) are `undecided` 

4. There are 3 types of processing possible 
    1. `Right Condition`: Every element on the right  of the  `right` pointer are guaranteed to be bigger than `pivot`
    2. `Left Condition`: Every element on the left of the  `left` pointer are guaranteed to be smaller than `pivot`
    3. `pre-step to reduce undecided`: Every element in between  `left` pointer and `right` pointer are undecided. At this point `right` is pointing an element which is smaller than pivot. This is incorrect situation. position `left+1` holds an element bigger than pivot i.e.'left'. This is a dead lock; neither left nor right pointer can move here .To make things better,  `swap` the elements of `a[left+1]` and `a[right]` so that in next loop we can reduce the undecided elements. 

    Note that the values are swapped, at this point `left+1` contains a smaller value and `right` contains a bigger value.

5. Loop `end` condition : when `left` and `right` are pointing to the same element , that is the end of loop. At this position the `pivot` is at right location in the array.   As we remember that the `left` pointer points to the pivot ; the element at `left` is correctly positioned..

6. now lets try the code for `partitioning`

````java
int partitioning( int[] a , int left , int right){
   // implicit pivot: a[left]

   while (left != right){
       if( a[right] >= a[left]){
           //Right condition 
           right--;
       }
       else if( a[left] >= a[left+1] ){
            // left condition 
            swap(a[left], a[left+1]);
            left++;
        } else{
            // pre-step to reduce undecided
            swap(a[left+1], a[right]);
        }
   }
   // return the  pivot position : i.e. left index 
   return left ;

}
````
#### Full Code
````java
public static void main(String args[]) {
		int[] a =  {7,2,8,4,3,6,9};
		sort(a);
		
		for( int i:a)
			System.out.print(i + "");
	}

	
	static void sort(int a[]) {
		sort(a, 0, a.length-1);	
	}
	
	static void sort(int a[], int left, int right) {
		//base condition
		if(left >= right ) 
			return; 
		
		
		int i = partition(a, left, right);
		sort(a , left, i-1) ;
		sort(a , i+1, right) ;
		
	}
	
	static int partition(int a[], int left, int right) {
		// left is the implicit pivot position
		while(left!=right) {
			if(a[right] >= a[left]) {
				// Right condition matched : a[right] >= pivot
				right --;
			} else if(a[left] >= a[left+1]) {
				// left condition matched : move the smaller element to the 
				// left of teh pivot a[left]
				swap(a, left,left+1);
				left++;
			}else {
				//  pre-step to reduce undecided
				swap(a, left+1,right);
			}
			
			
			
		}
		
		// at this stage the element at a[left] is positioned correctly 
		return left ;
	}


	private static void swap(int a[], int from, int to) {
		 int temp = a[from] ;
		 a[from] = a[to];
		 a[to] = temp;
		
	}

## Complexity Analysis

## Why Quick Sort is preferred over MergeSort for sorting Arrays 
Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesnâ€™t require any extra storage) whereas merge sort requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive. Allocating and de-allocating the extra space used for merge sort increases the running time of the algorithm. Comparing average complexity we find that both type of sorts have O(NlogN) average complexity but the constants differ. For arrays, merge sort loses due to the use of extra O(N) storage space.


## Finding the right pivot 
1. Simple Approach : Pick the first or last element of the range. (bad on partially sorted input) 2. Better Approach : Pick the item in the middle of the range. (better on partially sorted input)
3. Median element : However, picking any arbitrary element runs the risk of poorly partitioning the array of size n into two arrays of size 1 and n-1. If you do that often enough, your quicksort runs the risk of becoming O(n^2).

One improvement I've seen is pick `median(first, last, mid)`; In the worst case, it can still go to O(n^2), but probabilistically, this is a rare case.

### If you have selected a Pivot whihc is not sthe start or the end you need to do some extra work to get started.. 

1. Our algorithm explained above qoeks assuming teh `left` element is the pivot. 
2. If we decide that a[k] is our pivot , where `0<k<n-1`; we need to `swap(a[0],a[k])` as a pre processing step..
