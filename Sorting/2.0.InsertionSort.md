# Problem Statement   

Sort an Array using Insertion Sort 

# Analogy to Remember the Sorting Algo 
We can draw a simple analogy with  sorting a deck of cards ..

- Unsorted Deck of Cards

- Pass 1 : We start from second card 
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/166501059-084ad7e9-37b5-4089-9e2e-062d61d3fdbc.png)
  - We take out the second card 
  - We insert the card at. a place so that Cart 1 and Card 2 are sorted 
  - __at the end of this stage Card 1 , Card 2 are sorted__ 
- Pass 2
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/166501197-75334cbb-59fb-42b8-b6d4-eaa835abdc1e.png)
  - We take out the third card 
  - We insert the card at. a place so that Cart 1, Card 2 and Card 3 are sorted 
  - __at the end of this stage Card 1 , Card 2 and Card 3 are sorted__  
.....

You can see we are __Inserting__ thecard at the right place in evert step

# Strategy
 
1. If there is only 1 Card that is already sorted.. 
2. The Outer Loop
    - If there is only 1 element the element is already sorted
    - Hence the outer Loop starts at position `1` and continues till `N-1` ; outer loop `i=1 to N-1` 
    - **at the end of each iteration , all the elements till index `i`  ( including the element `a[i]`) will be in sorted position**

````java
// Outer Loop Code
for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++) {
// TO-DO
}
````
3. The Inner Loop 
    - the complex things happen here
    - it copies element a[i] to temp; this element will be **inserted** at teh right position 
    - This loop runs a finite number of times . i.e from element `i` (i.e parent loops current index) till j > 0 
    - it moves element `a[j-1] to a[j]` i.e one step towards right  if `a[j-1] > a[j]`
    - 

````java
private static void sort(int[] a) {
		// the first element is sorted already ...
		// Outer loop starts with index 1
		int j = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++) {
			// Copy the element in question to temp 
			int temp = a[i];
			
			//decrement j untill a[j-1] >= temp
			for (j = i; j > 0 && a[j - 1] >= temp; j--) {
				a[j] = a[j - 1];
			}
			a[j] = temp;
		}

	}
