# Sorting Summary

# Levels of sorting 
 - L-0 Sorting Algorithms 
   - Bubble Sort 
    - O(N^2)
    - Fails  for large datasets 
   - Selection Sort 
    - O(N^2)
    - Not Stable 
    - In place sorting 
   - Insertion Sort 
    - O(N^2)
    - **Faster than Bubble and Selection** 
    - In place sorting 
    - Stable 
    - runs very quickly if teh data is small 
    - works good if teh array is already sorted.  
 - L-1 Sorting ALgorithms ( O (nlogn)) 
    - MergeSort 
      - Auxiliary place is needed 
    - QuickSort 
      - if teh pivot is good then  O(nlogn) in average case
      - in worst case o(n^2) , if a bad partitioning is chosen in an almost sorted data
      - faster than merge sort 
    - Heap Sort 
       - slower than QuickSort 
       - non a stable sorting algo      
 - L-2 Sorting ALgorithms  : Hybrid Algos
  - Timsort : Highly optimized Merge Sort O(nLogn) space O(n)
  - Introsort : combines QuickSort, HeapSort and Insertion sort  

# Stable vs Unstable Sort 

1. If the relative order of same elements are maintained then it is stable sort , if teh relative order is not maintained then unstable 
2. In this array we want to sort based on ID , duplicate IDs may exist . In the stable version the relative order of matching IDs are maintained

3. How to achieve stable behaviour  : by applying strict comparison ; this code is rfrom Insertion Sort code. To make it stable we need to compare `a[j - 1] > temp;` and if we `a[j - 1] >= temp;` it becomes unstable
 ````
 	//decrement j untill a[j-1] > temp
			for (j = i; j > 0 && a[j - 1] > temp; j--) {
				a[j] = a[j - 1];
			}
			a[j] = temp;
		}
