# Find the Celebrity

In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone in the party. We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “. Find the stranger (celebrity) in the minimum number of questions.

Examples:  
````
Input:
MATRIX = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
           {0, 0, 1, 0},
           {0, 0, 0, 0},
           {0, 0, 1, 0} }
Output:id = 2
Explanation: The person with ID 2 does not 
know anyone but everyone knows him

## Question 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-celebrity-problem/ 


## Explanation 

## Strategy
1. Everyone knows the celebrity 
2. Celebrity knows no one 
3. in a board only one celebrity is present ; there can not be 2 celebrities (logically)

4. in the board : 
   -  `i` represents the person 
   -  `j` represents the other persons 

5. `cell[i][j]` --> represents whether `i` knows `j`
6. if  `cell[i][j] == 1` ; it means `i` knows `j` ;  
   - Confirmed fact: we can say  `i` is not a celebrity 
   - we can not say anything about  j yet, because we do not know whether `j` knows all or everyone knows `j`
8. if  `cell[i][j] == 0` ; it means `i` does not know `j` ; so `j` is not a celebrity  
   - Confirmed fact: we can say  `j` is not a celebrity 
   - we can not say anything about  i yet, because we do not know whether `i` knows all or everyone knows `i`

- **Prerequsiite** 
  - Rules
     - Everyone knows the celebrity 
     - Celebrity knows no one 
  - we shall apply the process of **elemination** 
  - at the beginning everyone is a **possible** celebrity ; we put them all into a `stack` ; thsi stack contains teh possible celebrities.
  - we check first 2 element and get the inference   base on the value in the cell. We eleminate the non celebrity 
  - we continue to do this until we have one last element left 
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172687764-75cd8b45-3262-4995-a49f-223c5faa9a1a.png)
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172687862-8e6c020e-ddff-4a08-98c4-f81946c87720.png)

  - we have eleminated all non celebrities by `n-1` comparison
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172688509-6ba8ee40-2644-4b14-8066-6b8baa0c0119.png)

  - now we have only 1 element left in stack. We can not say yet whether it is a celebrity or a non celebrity. 
  - to be a celebrity we need to ensure
     - everyone knows element x ( in our example element `2`) 
       - we need to check all element in array where `j=2` except [2][2] which is self . for all celsl except self cell it should contain value `1`
       - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172689215-c889e9ed-d3fe-4901-b8e1-780df413eba7.png)

     - element x knows no one ( in our example element `2` ) 
       - for all clls excpt teh self cell it should have value 0  
       - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172689433-71cb2b57-e659-43fb-9d8c-0b414588342c.png)

## Code
````java
int findCelebrity(int[][] persons) {
		Stack<Integer> celebs = new Stack();

		// Assume everyone is a celebrity
		for (int i = 0; i < persons[0].length; i++)
			celebs.push(i);

		// Process
		while (celebs.size() >= 2) {

			int person1 = celebs.pop();
			int person2 = celebs.pop();

			if (persons[person1][person2] == 1) {
				// Person 1 knows Person 2
				// Person 1 is not a celebrity
				// Person 2 is apotential celebrity
				celebs.push(person2);
			} else {
				// Person 2 is not a celebrity
				// Person 1 is a potential Celebrity
				celebs.push(person1);
			}

		}

		// So far in the loop we eleminated all n-1 elements which are not a celebrity

		// We we have only 1 element left; which is a potential celebrity
		// to confirm we need to do the following check
		int potelTialCeleb = celebs.pop();
		for (int i = 0; i < persons[0].length; i++) {
			
			if (i != potelTialCeleb) {
				// if someone does not know potelTialCeleb
				if(persons[i][potelTialCeleb] != 1)
					return -1 ;
				
				//If potential celeb knows someone 
				if(persons[potelTialCeleb][i] == 1)
					return -1;
