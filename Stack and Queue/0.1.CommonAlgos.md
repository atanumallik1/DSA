# Stack Algo

## 1. Duplicate Brackets
- Pepcoding : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMPXhEdpXFA&list=PL-Jc9J83PIiEyUGT3S8zPdTMYojwZPLUM&index=3 

### Problem 
  - (a+b) *((C+D)) --> Contains Duplicate Bracket 
  - (a+b) *(C+D) --> Does not contains Duplicate Bracket 

### Algo
  - push every element on stack 
  - if we find a cosing bracket `)`; pop all elements untill the next `(`
  - if there is no middle element between `(` and `)` then it must be a duplicate bracket 

## 2. Next Greater Element on Right 
- Pepcoding : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSf9vPtKcmI&list=PL-Jc9J83PIiEyUGT3S8zPdTMYojwZPLUM&index=7

### Explanation
 - or a given array find teh next greater element element on right 
 - compelxity `O(n)`

### Algo
 - we want to finf the next Greater Element on the Right 
 - if we start with the last element ( `arr[n-1]` ) , there is no `next` element , and clearly there is **no** `next greater element`
 - As per Dynamic Programming rule , on the right hand side we have smaller problem ; we start from the last element of the array
 - Direction :
   - right to left ; end to start   

 - we put the last element of the array and put it in stack 
 - we make the next greater element on right for teh last element = `-1`
 - from the second last element of teh array till teh first element of teh array , we perform the following 
    -  we continue to pop elelemts from stack which are smaller than the current array element 
    -  the element on top of the stack is the next greater element for teh current array element 
    -  if no elelemnt on stack is present, then there is no greater element on right 
    -  now we put the current element on the stack

### Complexity 
 - `O(n)`
- the inner while loop runs fewer time 
- each element is pushed and popped only once 
- compleity is `O(n) + O(n)`


## 3.Stock Span
- we have an array of integers indicating the stoc price 
- find the price of stock span 
- in other words : if we are at an element of an array at index `i` and we find the previous greater element at `i-3`, the stock span for element `i` is `3`

### Algorithms 
 - We want to find teh next greater element on the left 
 - We shall use a stack , but in the stack we put the `index` of element **not** the element itself
 - We start from the left hand side 
 - we create an array and Precompute the `index` of `LGE` in this array



## 4. Largest Area Histogram 

### Explanation 
- Pepcoding https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0do2734xhnU&list=PL-Jc9J83PIiEyUGT3S8zPdTMYojwZPLUM&index=12 

### Algo 
 - for each element in the array we want to find teh `index` of 
   - next smaller element on right 
   - next greater element on left 
 - next we calculate the span and area of each element by 
   - index of next smaller  element on right - index of next smaller element on left -1
   - area = span * height 
 - we find the max  area



## 5. Celebrity Problem 
A celebrity is a person : 
 - A person who does not know anyone 
 - Wvery one knows that person 
 - there are 5 persons here , 3 is known to everyone but 3 knows no one . 3 is acelebrity 
 - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68387132/172223460-e33bfeef-895a-47d0-8051-68304e7a39dc.png)
 - there can be only 1 celebrity 
 - there can be no celebrity 
### Explanation 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHM1FPLGcsU&list=PL-Jc9J83PIiEyUGT3S8zPdTMYojwZPLUM&index=19
### Algo 
- We put all teh elements ( persons ) into teh stack 
 - at the end teh stack will only have a celebrity left 
- we pick first 2 elements 
  - does element a know b  ; if yes `a` is not a celebrity , we push back only `b` into teh stack and ignote `a`
  - if no then `b` is certainly not a celebrity, we put back `a`

- we continue untill there is only 1 element left 
- last element is the cebrity 


## 6.Min Stack 
- A min Stack is a astack with an additional operation `getMin()`
- teh stack will also return teh minimim element in `O(1)`

### Explanation
- Neet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkLl7nAwDPo

### Strategy 
 - We take a natural stack 
 - We also take another stack whick is suppose to contain the minimum so far
 - we push and pop into both teh stcak **together**
