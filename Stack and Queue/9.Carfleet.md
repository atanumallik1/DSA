# Car Fleet
````
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.

## Explanation 
- Neetcode  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr6T-3yB9RM&t=715s 

## problem Explanation 
- Cars are moving in one lane in one direction 
- some cars are closer to teh target some cars are far 
- they all move at different speed 
- 2 cars collide and make a fleet if teh car at front moves slower and the card behind moves faster , fleet means the cars are together and tehy reach teh target same time 

- given all the details ; find how many fleets exists 



## Strategy 
- **Preprocessing**
    - We first **sort** the Cars based on their location , in the input array we have seperate array for Locations an Speed. we sort them . 
    - For sorting in Java , we need to create the `Comparator` class based on location , we use `Arrays.sort` to sort it.
    ````java
    class Car {
	    public int position;
	    public int speed;

	    public Car(int position, int speed) {
		    this.speed = speed;
		    this.position = position;
	    }
    }

    class CarComparator implements Comparator<Car> {
	    // Sort based on position
	    public int compare(Car c1, Car c2) {
		    return (c1.position - c2.position);

	    }
    ````

    ````java
            Car[] cars = new Car[position.length];
		    for (int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
			    cars[i] = new Car(position[i], speed[i]);
		    }

		// Sort the Cars based on their position
		// the last Car has the shortest distance to go
		// the first car has the longest distance to go
		Arrays.sort(cars, new CarComparator());
    ````

- If we sort them , we shall be able to visualize the cars in a picture line the following

- Fleet would look like

- **Direction**
  - Here we need to think like DP
  - The last car(with speed `2`) which is closer to teh target moves at a constant speed . It needs `( Target - Position) / Speed` units of time to reach the target
  - If there is  second car behind it which moves at higher speed, the second car needs to  slowdown to to match thsi early car and move at same speed. These 2 cars make a fleet and can be considered as a single car. 
  - now we look back in teh queue whhat is the next car , does it make a fleet ?? 

  - This way we continue to build fleets

- Final Algo 
  - We traverse from teh end , element by element 
  - Calculate the time to reach destination and put into the stack
  - We need a stack, the stack contains the time taken by a car to reach target ; we shall build up our algo based on thsi stack
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172451922-3eb747a2-c009-4e98-b892-3534706f3eb6.png)

  - The moment we we have 2 elements in stack 
    - we pop 2 elemenst `Last` and `second last`
    - we check if tehy can create a fleet ( if `last` takes more time than `secondlast`)
      - we assume they create a fleet 
      - we push the `last` i.e slower element into the stack
      - 
    - in case they can not create a fleet 
      - we push them back into teh stack in correct order 
      - 

    ````java
          if (stack.size() >= 2) {
				Double last = stack.pop();
				Double secondLast = stack.pop();

				if (last <= secondLast) {
					stack.push(secondLast);
				}

				else {
					stack.push(secondLast);
					stack.push(last);
				}

			}
    ````

- the number of elements in stack denotes fleet size

		return stack.size();
