# Stock Span
Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were `[100,80,60,70,60,75,85]`, then the stock spans would be `[1,1,1,2,1,4,6]`.


Example 1
````
Input
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

Explanation
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6

## Leetcode 
- https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/ 

- Try with  test data : 31 41 48 59 79 

## Approach
1. We need to calculate `Larger element on Left` using  a `Stack`
2. Nomally in these exampels we get an `array` to work with , but in this case we need to use an `Arraylist` 
3. We assume that there  is a biggest element on left i.e at index `-1`
4. Thats why we return 1 for the first element
````java
if(priceList.size() == 0){
             priceList.add(price);
             // Add the index of the current element as 0
             // into teh stack
             lel.push(0);
              
            // we assume that there is +INFINITY at index -1
             return 1;
            
        }
````

5. We need to `delete` all elements from `stack` whose values are `smaller` than the current Price
````java
 // pop all smaller  price indices from the Stack 
            while(!lel.isEmpty() && priceList.get(lel.peek()) <= price  ){
                lel.pop();
            }
````

6. Now we need to calculate the distance to the bigger element on left 
  - If the stack is empty : the index is -1
  - if the stack is not empty , top element points to the bigger element's index

## Code 
````java
class StockSpanner {
    // Stack of Index : lel larger element on left
    Stack<Integer> lel ;
    List<Integer> priceList;
     
    
    public StockSpanner() {
        lel = new Stack();
        priceList = new ArrayList();
       
        
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        
         
        // First Element
        if(priceList.size() == 0){
             priceList.add(price);
             // Add the index of the current element as 0
             // into teh stack
             lel.push(0);
              
            // we assume that there is +INFINITY at index -1
             return 1;
            
        }else{
            
            // pop all smaller  price indices from the Stack 
            while(!lel.isEmpty() && priceList.get(lel.peek()) <= price  ){
                lel.pop();
            }
                // the top index refers to a bigger element
                
                // 2. add teh current price to teh price List 
                  priceList.add(price);
            
                 int result ;
                 if(lel.isEmpty()){
                     result = priceList.size()  ;
                 }else
                  result = priceList.size()-lel.peek() -1 ;
                
                // 3. Update Lel Stack with index of current price
                  lel.push(priceList.size()-1);
                
                // 1. Calculate teh difference of current element and stack index 
                
                return result;
                
           
            
        }
        
    }
}
