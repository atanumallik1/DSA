# Climbing Stairs - Dynamic Programming using Tabulation 
1. You are given a number n, representing the number of stairs in a staircase.
2. You are on the 0th step and are required to climb to the top.
3. In one move, you are allowed to climb 1, 2 or 3 stairs.

## Strategy
- we shall solve it using `dp` of `1D` array

- **Storage and Meaning**
   - If we are standing on a stair step `X` , how many ways we can reach the ground ....

- **Direction**
   - on left side we have smaller problems ; on right side we have bigger problems; we move from left to right 

- **Travel and Solve**
   - the possible ways to reach ground fron a stair step `N` =  the possible ways to reach ground fron a stair step `N-1` + the possible ways to reach ground fron a stair step `N-2` + the possible ways to reach ground fron a stair step `N-3`
   - we are considering 3 previous steps since there are 3 possible jumps : 1,2,3

## Details 
- DP array size 
  - If the stair size in `n`, we are taking an array of size `n+1`  ; we need to store possibilities for element starting from `0` to `N`; total size is `N+1`
- Base case 
  - `dp[0] = 1` ; this means we are at ground level ; no need to go anywhere, but it is still and option . Hence `dp[0] = 1`

- Travel and Solve 
  - `dp[N] =  dp[N-1] + dp[N-2] + dp[N-3]`  
  - Edge cases 
     - `N = 1` or `N =2`
