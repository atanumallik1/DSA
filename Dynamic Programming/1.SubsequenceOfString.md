# Check if a given String is a Sub Sequence of another String 

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


Example 1:
````
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
````
Example 2:
````
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
````

## Strategy
 1. We want to match character by character  
 2. S1(source) and S2 ( sunsequence)
 2.  Put pointer `i` at the start of string `S1` ; and `j` at `S2`
 3.  ````
     while(i< S1.length && j<s2.length)
     if S2[j] === S1[i]
       i++; j++

     else
       i++  

    end while;

    if(j<S2.length)
      // not a sub sequence

  ## Alter approach using Recusrsion
  1. Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
  2. Does `a` appear anywhere in `ahbgdc`
      -  since it does the remaining string is `hbgdc`
  3. Does `b` appear anywhere in `hbgdc`
      -  since it does the remaining string is `gdc`

  5. Does `c` appear anywhere in `gdc`
      - yes 

  6. If any of the steps is no then the answer is false
