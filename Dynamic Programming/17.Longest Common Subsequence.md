# Longest Common Subsequence in 2 Strings

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:
````
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  

Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
````
Example 2:
````
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
````
Output: 3
````
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

## DP Strategy 
- Storage and Meaning
  - we need 2d `dp` array of size `[m+1][n+1]` where m,n are the array length 
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172021702-96c415e6-8df7-4954-a5f8-eb963748b4c8.png)
  - meaning 
    -  if we are at cell `dp[i][j]` ; what is the longest subsequence length between `arr1[i]-arr1[m-1]` and `arr2[j]-arr2[n-1]`
  -  
- Direction 
  - in reverse order 
  - **Note** : we start from last character of bothe the arrays  
- Travel and Solve  
  - nature of movement : 
    - diagonal : when characters match 
    - right and down : when characters do not match 
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172021814-e02a8838-9772-44f7-a0f0-044e078d6883.png)

  - default values
    - we create `dp` array of  `[m+1][n+1]`
    - we dafault the count value to `0` for these last row and last column 


  - Traversal  : reverse order 
  - Collect value 
    - we need to move bottom up 
    - if character match in both arrays 
      - take the count of diagonally child character and add 1 ( for teh matching character )
    -  if character does not match in both arrays 
      - take the count of next chanracter on right 
      - take the count of next character down 
      - take teh max value 
  - final result 
      - availabel at `dp[0][0]`
