# Buy and Sell Share 3: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks with Transaction Fee and Infinite Transactions
1. You are given a number n, representing the number of days.
2. You are given n numbers, where ith number represents price of stock on ith day.
3. You are required to print the maximum profit you can make if you are allowed infinite transactions.
Note - There can be no overlapping transaction. One transaction needs to be closed (a buy followed by a sell) before opening another transaction (another buy)

## Approach 
- We shall continue `Buy-Sell .. Buy-Sell`
- Bought State Profit :BSP
    - we shall do `BS BS BS ..... B` , if we have one unit of share due to the last `B` , what is my profit status at a particular day 
    - at this state I have one share  
- Sold State Profit SSP
    - we shall do `BS BS BS ..... BS` , if we have clean plate , what is my profit status at a particular day
    - at this state I have no share  



## Table DP Explanation 
- Unit Defintion 
   - Buy State : At buy state we want to calculate the money we spend and the no of shares acquired 
       - active component: money 
   - Sell State  : here we calculaet how mych money we have in hand
       - active component: money

- Base case
   - on Day 0 at share price 10 : the buystate and sell state look like

- Calculate new buy state 
     - we retain the old buy state : assume the money in old buy state = -10
        - at this point we have 1 share  

     - we calculate on top of last sell state :
        - current buy price is 15 , last sell state monety = 0
        - if we buy today out wallet money = last old state price - (current price) = -15
        - at this point we have 1 share  
     - out of both the  2 states we condier te better state : the first state is better , we choose it as new but state

- Calculate new sell state 
     -  we retain the old sell state : assume the money in old sell state =  0
     -  we calculate on top of old buy state :
        -  current sell price is 15 , last sell state monety = 0
        -  if we sell the last purchased share we go to state  = 15-10 - transaction fee (3) = 2
     - the second proposal is better we choose option 2
