# Tiling with Dominoes Dynamic Programming

1. You are given a number `n` representing the length of a floor space which is 2m wide. It's a 2 * n board.
2. You've an infinite supply of 2 * 1 tiles.
3. You are required to calculate and print the number of ways floor can be tiled using tiles.

## Approach  
- We want to divide this problem in recursion ; we shall create a 1 dimensional DP array of length `N+1`
- Let us assume the length of floor is `N` 
- The first block can be placed in 2 ways 
  - First Way :  lets assume how many ways we can fill the remaining part : `X` ways
  - Second Way : lets assume how many ways we can fill the remaining part : `Y` ways

- Now possible ways to cover a floor of Length `N` = `X` + `Y`

## Detailed Analysis 
- Base cases 
  -  If I place the domino vertically : only 1 way to fill it 
  -  If I place the domino horizontally : only 1 way to fill it

  -  due to this fact we can fill `dp[1] = 1 , dp[2] = 1`

- Next Recursive calls 
  -  We can place the block in approach 1 ; we are left with `N-1` empty floor area ; we ned to find how many ways this area can be filled

  -  We can place the block in approach 2 ; this leaves an awkward empty area ; we ned to find how many ways this area can be filled 
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/171401185-296151b2-944f-4080-b594-6feeb7142305.png)
      - The number of ways this area can be filled is equivalent to possible ways to fill an area of length `N-2` , since there is only 1 way to fill the Odd part

   - So the problem translates to : number of different ways 
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/171402088-2e8cad91-7577-427c-98fd-9233354561a6.png)
      - Number of Ways to fill a floor of length `N` = number of ways to fill `N-1` + number of ways to fill `N-2`

- Note
  - This code  takes an array of length `N+1`; this is for ease fo handlng
