# Minimum Cost Paths


1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.
2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.
3. You are given n*m numbers, representing elements of 2d array a, which represents a maze.
4. You are standing in top-left cell and are required to move to bottom-right cell.
5. You are allowed to move 1 cell right (h move) or 1 cell down (v move) in 1 motion.
6. Each cell has a value that will have to be paid to enter that cell (even for the top-left and bottom-right cell).
7. You are required to traverse through the matrix and print the cost of path which is least costly.

## Understanding 
 - We are given an array where a value indicates the cost to `exit` the cell
 - one can move from left to right or top to bottom

 - We need to find teh minumum cost to reach cell `[n-1][n-1]` from cell `[0][0]`


## DP Strategy 
 - Storage and Meaning 
    -  we crete a 2D DP array 
    -  here a value at a certain cell indicates the minimum cost to reach teh target from this cell

 - Direction 
    - if we are at the bottom right we have a very small problem to solve ; the cost to exit thsi cell is the answer 
    - teh top left cell has a bigger problem  
    - direction id from bottom right to top left

 - Traverse and solve 
     - BAse case 
       - For teh last row we can only move from right  to left 
       - For the last column we can onlu move from bottom to up
       - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/172921562-443a47a6-74c4-4a81-9702-387726c37fcd.png)
   
     - We start from teh last cell where teh `dp[n-1][n-1] = data[n-1][n-1]`
       - For the remaining cells we need to compare between cell below and cell right abd take the minimum
       - value of `dp[i][j] =  Min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) + data[i][j]`
