# Maximum Sum Non Adjacent Elements

1. You are given n numbers
2. You are required to find the maximum sum of a subsequence with no adjacent elements.

Example 1
````
Numbers: 5 ,  10 , 10 , 100 , 5 , 6
````
Constraint:
- We can not pick 2 numbers adjascenat to each other 

Expectation

## Strategy 
  - This is a DP Problem of type `Include /Exclude Problems` ; will be solbed with 1D array
  - **Storage and Meaning**

  - **Identify the direction** 
     -  Left to right since in left side we have smaller problem 
    
  - **Travel and Solve** 
     - We create 2 arrays for include and exclude 
     - We can either `include` an element or `exclude` an element
     - we can `include` an element if teh previous element was `excluded` ; this is due to non adjascenat clause
