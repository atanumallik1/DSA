# Coin Change Combination 

1. You are given a number n, representing the count of coins.
2. You are given n numbers, representing the denominations of n coins.
3. You are given a number "amt".
4. You are required to calculate and print the number of combinations of the n coins using which the amount "amt" can be paid.
- Note1 - You have an infinite supply of each coin denomination i.e. same coin denomination can be used for many installments in payment of "amt"

- Note2 - You are required to find the count of combinations and not permutations i.e.
2 + 2 + 3 = 7 and 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 and 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 are different permutations of same combination. You should treat them as 1 and not 3.

## Example 
- coin : `2 3 5`
- Target Sum `7`
- Find the number of combinations to achieve sum `7`

- Travel and Solve  


- Storage Size
  - we need to create teh array of size `n+1`
  - each cell represents teh target sum , hence we need representation of target sum starting from `0 to n`
  - hence teh array length is `n+1` 
- base case 
  - if we are at cell `0` of DP array 
  - how many ways we can Pay amount `0` using teh coins we have
  - answer is `1` ; do not give any coin ; so teh vase case is `dp[0]= 1`
- Why this approach work
