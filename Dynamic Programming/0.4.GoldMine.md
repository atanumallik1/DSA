# Path with Maximum Gold 
1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.
2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.

## Insights 
1. You are given a board with value of gold in each cell

4. You need to start from column `j=0` and end in column `j=N-1` and collect max gold.

## DP apparoach 
1. Storage and Meaning 
  - If you are at a cell in DP how much maximul gold you can collect   by traversing through the cells towards the right

2. Direction 
  - On the right side there is very clear decision and teh problem is small
  - on the left side , the problem is bigger 
  - we move from right to left

3. Traverse and Solve 
  - we start from right side column
   - for each row we assign teh gold value 
- now we move teh second last column
   - we identify all possible cells that we can move and collect teh max gold, 
   - we add teh max gold and teh price of teh current cell

## Code
- We start from last column
- we traverse row by row 
- we need special handling for 
  - LAst column 
  - First Row 
  - Last Row 

- the final result is the max value in first column
