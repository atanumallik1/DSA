# Arrange Buildings Dynamic Programming 

In this problem, 
1. You are given a number n, which represents the length of a road. The road has n plots on it's each side.
2. The road is to be so planned that there should not be consecutive buildings on either side of the road.
3. You are required to find and print the number of ways in which the buildings can be built on both side of roads

## Detailing of the Problem
- Plots picture : we can place a building or keep it empty

- Valid placement since no 2 buildings ar next to  each other

- We need to find how many such combinations exist 

## Strategy 

1. This problem is same like `Count binary String` problem . In previous problem 2 zeros`0` can not be next to each other ; here 2 buidings can not benext to each other  
2. We want to find how many valid combinations can exist in one side .Let us assume it is `X`. No of valid combination in one side of road is `X`
3. then the number of **valid combinations in both sides** are `X * X`
