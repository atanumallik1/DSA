# Dynamic Programming 


- High Level Steps 
  - Storage and Meaning : identify how we want to craete teh DP storate and what is the meaning 
  - direction : identify whcih side represents smaller problemsn and which side represents bigger problems ; we want to move from smaller to bigger 
  - Travel and Solve : move and solve

  - Coin sum Permutations 
     - we have infinite supply of coins 
     - we can use a coin more than once 
    - we are given  coins of type `[2,3,5]` ; how many valid **permutations** can make up a sum of `7`
    - here we need a 1D array to solve the problem   
    ````
      2,2,3
      3, 2,2,
      2,3,2
      2,5
      5,2 
    ````
  - Coin Sum combination
     - we have infinite supply of coins 
     - we can use a coin more than once 
     - we are given  coins of type `[2,3,5]` ; how many valid **combinations** can make up a sum of `7`
     - - here we need a 1D array to solve the problem   
    ````
      2,2,3
      2,5
    ````

  - Coin Sum Target Sum  
     - This is a target sum subset problem 
     - we can use one coin only once
     - this is 0/1 knapsack problem 
     - here we need a 2D array to solve the problem   
     - we are given  coins of type `[2,3,5]` ; how many valid possibilities can make up a sum of `7`

     - DP Board : 2D board `i = 0 .... Target Sum ` ; `j= emty coin , one row for each coin`
       - DP Board looks like this: 
       - here a cell represents the fllowing question 
         >>>>can I get sum 3 with with no coin , 2 coin and 3 coin ??

        we shall build DP table based on this knowledge ...   


## Discussion 
 - Should we solve this problem using tabulation or memoization ?
 - both are fine 
 - Memoization to be used for Recusrsive approaches : little diffiicult to visualize 
 - Tabulation for Iterative approaches: it is easy to visualize
