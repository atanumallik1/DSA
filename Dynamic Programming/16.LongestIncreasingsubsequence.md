# Longest Increasing subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 
Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
````
Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
````
## Explanation

- start from front : Pepcoding https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odrfUCS9sQk

## Leetcode 
- https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/ 

## Discussion 
 - Should we solve this problem using tabulation or memoization ?
 - both are fine 
 - Memoization to be used for Recusrsive approaches : little diffiicult to visualize 
 - Tabulation for Iterative approaches: it is easy to visualize 


## What is longest increasing subsequence 
- in subsequence relative order to be maintained 
````
[0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
````

- possible sub sequences 
````
  0,3,4,8
  0,2,5,0,1
````
- following are not valis dubsequnce 
````
5,2,8 <--- 2 appears before 5 in original array
````
- sub sequences in **increasing order**
  - relative order to be maintained
  - must be increasing order 
````
0,1
0,2,5,8
2,4,6
````


## DP : starting from end 
- approach based on neetcode 
- Storage and Meaning
  - we shall take a 1D array 
  - if we are at index `i` in teh DP array, what is the maximum subsequence length if we start from `array[i]` 
  - base case
    - if we are at the last position in the [dp] array, it means we are at the end position of the original `array`
    - the  maximum subsequence length  1, since we cabn create a sub sequence with only 1 element

- direction 
  - left to right 
  - left side we have smaller problem , if we move towards right the problem becomes big  
  
- Travel and Solve 
  -  if you are at a specific index of teh array 
  	- if you are at position `0` of teh array; we are looking at element `arr[0]=1`  
  -  starting at that index , howmany valid sub sequences can be made where the firt string is `arr[0]=1` 
     - `1,4 / 1,3/ 1,2,4 / 1,2,3`  
  -  what is the maximum length :`3`
  -  store it in `DP[0] = 3`

  - Pseudo code 
    - if you are at element `i` of array 
      - loop through all the elemenst in array location `i+1` till `i=N-1`
      - if the element is greater than `a[i]` ; it is a candidate for valid sub sequence 
      - consider the `dp[j]` value ; save it if it is maximum among the remaining 
  - this maximum value indicates teh maximum valid sunsequence lenth based on teh memaing next elements 
  - current dp value = 1+ the MAX ( 1 is coming ue to currnt element)    

## Code
````java
public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
		int dp[] = new int[nums.length];
		int maxLength = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			if (i == nums.length - 1) {
				dp[i] = 1; // base case
				maxLength = dp[i];
				continue;
			}

			// find all elements whihc are bigger than current element
			// pick the one with highest length
			int maxCountNextElements = 0;
			for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length ; j++) {
				if(nums[j] > nums[i])
			  	 // Find maximum valid sub sequmce length for teh next characcters till end
				 maxCountNextElements = Math.max(maxCountNextElements, dp[j]);

			}
			// Calculate teh DP for current element
			dp[i] = maxCountNextElements + 1;

			// Calculate teh global Max length so far
			maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i]);
		}

		return maxLength;

	}

## DP : starting from start 
- approach based on pepcoding 
- Storage and Meaning
  - if we are at a certain position of an array , say index `[i]`, what is teh meaximum length of  valid subsequences where teh array ends at `a[i]`
