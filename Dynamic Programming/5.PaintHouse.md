# Paint House 

2. In the next n rows, you are given 3 space separated numbers representing the cost of painting nth house with red or blue or green color.
3. You are required to calculate and print the minimum cost of painting all houses without painting any consecutive house with same color.

Example 1
````
Data:       R   G    B
House 1:    1   5    7
House 2:    5   8    4
House 3:    3   2    9
House 4:    1   2    4
````

- We need to find what is the minimum cost of painting ?
- No 2 adjascent houses can be f same colour

## Strategy
0. We have 2 dimentions , colours and houses , we need 2D matrix to represent

3. **Direction**  
  - From Top to Bottom ; we solve 1 row at a time ; i.e one house at a time , the 2 houses, then 3 houses , finally 4 houses 
 
4. **Travel and solve**

Complexity : O(n^3)
<br>
There is a chance of optimization :
We can compute rowise lease and second least fron each DP row before we move to second  row .<br>
