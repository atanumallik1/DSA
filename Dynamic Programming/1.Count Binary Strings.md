# Count Binary Strings 

1. You are given a number n.
2. You are required to print the number of binary strings of length n with no consecutive 0's.

## Strategy
- DP Problem Steps 
  - Storge and Meaning : determine what type of DP storage we want and what is the meaning of it? 
  - Find Direction  : find in which direction the smaller probelm is and in which direction bigger problems are 
  - Travel and Solve    : trvale and solve 


- **Storage and Meaning**

  - Thsi picture represents our DP array and the interpretation of the cell 
  - Left Index : binary characters (`0 or 1`)
  - Top  Index: string of length X

- **direction**
  - teh left side indicates smaller length 
  - for example`0` , it means the count of binary strings which ends with `0` or `1` but having length `0` . The count will be 0, since no such length could exist 
  - For example `3` :    it means the count of binary strings which ends with `0` or `1` but having length `3` . The count will be 5,  refer to teh traversal picture 
  - so we move from left to right 

- **Travel and Solve**

  - Logic :
     - Constarint : we can not have 2 consecutive 0
     - to form a next string ending with 0 , we can take the strings ending with `1` and add a `0` at the end
     - to form a next string ending with 1 , we can take the strings ending with `1` or `0` and add a `1` at the end

- **Final Result**
  - sum of Both the counts
