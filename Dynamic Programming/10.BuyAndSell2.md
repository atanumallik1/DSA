# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks - 2 (Infinite Transactions)
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

Example 1:
````
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
````
Example 2:
````
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

## Approach 
1. at the beginning ; `buyDate`,`sellDate` at index 0
````
buyDate;sellDate = 0
````
2. in every Peak we move teh Sale Date 
````
if a[i] > a[i-1]
  sellDate ++;
````
3. In everyDip , we book profit and re initialize `buyDate`,`sellDate`

````
else 
    profit += a[sellDate] - a[buyDate];
    buyDate = sellDate = i ;
````
4. Explicitly we need to handle teh last price increase . This is important since we collect in every dip ; if the last path is a hill , then the collection isnot happening in teh loop ; 

````
 //We need to settle the last increase seperately 
        
        profit += a[saleDate] - a[buyDate];
        return profit;
````

## Code
````java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] a) {
        int profit = 0;
        int buyDate = 0; 
        int saleDate = 0;
        
        for(int i =1 ;i< a.length ; i++){
            
            if(a[i] > a[i-1])
            {   
                // the price is increased, move the saleDate
                saleDate++;
            }else{
                //book ptofit 
               profit += a[saleDate] - a[buyDate];
                // Reinitialize buydate and saledate 
                buyDate = i ;
                saleDate = i;
            }
               
        }
        //We need to settle the last increase seperately 
        
        profit += a[saleDate] - a[buyDate];
