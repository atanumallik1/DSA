# Climbing Stairs with Jumps

1. You are given a number n, representing the number of stairs in a staircase.
2. You are on the 0th step and are required to climb to the top.
3. You are given n numbers, where ith element's value represents - till how far from the step  you could jump to in a single move.  
4. You are required to print the number of different paths via which you can climb to the top.

## Explanation
 - `N = 6` , we have 6 steps 
 - allowed jumps at each step: `a[0] = 2  , a[1] = 3 ,  a[2] = 0 , a[3] = 1 ,  a[4] = 2 , a[5] = 3`
 - It means 
    - if we are at stair step 5, we can take 3 jumps 
    -  if we are at stair step 2, we can take 0 jumps

- DP : We can create a DP array of 1 Dimention 
- **Storage and Meaning**
   - We can craete an 1D array 
   - Meaning : How many possible ways to reach the top from level current cell

- **Direction**
  - the final stair has 1 possibility : do not move 
  - lower steps have more possibility 
  - we move from right to left 
  - 
- **Travel and solve**
   - Base case 
     - if we are at final step how many ways are there to reach ; there is only 1 way ; just stand there ..

   - Traverse 
     - move to all possible cells and cound teh sum of **valid** possibilities

## Details
- Note:  here teh DP array is of size `n+1` ; since we need to create a bigegr array as we want to reach `n`th node from index `0`. `0` to `N`th meaning we need an array of length `n+1`

- Let us assume that awe are ate cell 8, howmany minimum jumps are needed from gere to reach 10 ?

- Answer :
  - with 1 jump (length 1) we can reach cell `9` with value `1`
  - with 1 jump (length 2) we can reach cell `10` with value `0`  
  - we shall choose teh one with min value : cell `10` with value `0`
  - number of jumps needed is : 1 + value of cell 10 = 1+ 0 = 1
  - general formula : `Min value of all target cells`  + 1
