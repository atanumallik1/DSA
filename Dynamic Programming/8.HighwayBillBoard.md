# Highway Billboard Problem 

1. You are given a number `M` representing length of highway(range).
2. You are given a number `N` representing number of bill boards.
3. You are given N space separated numbers representing `(P)`position of bill-boards.
4. You are given N space separated numbers representing `(R)`revenue corresponding to each `(P)`position.
5. You are given a number T such that bill-boards can only be placed after specific distance(T).
6. Find the maximum revenue that can be generated.

## Explnation
- Length of teh Road is `20`
- 5 bill boards are present with following details
````
    6    8    12     14      16  <------ Position on teh Road in terms of miles 
    5    8    5       3      1   <------ value it brings

````
- constraint: no 2 billbaords are placed within `3` miles
- What is teh maximum value the billbaord can generate  

- since each bill board brings some value what is the maximum value each bill boards can generate 


## Approach 

1. Storage and Meaning 
   - we shall crete 1D array indicating the miles.
   - Meaning :If I am standing at a specific location what is teh maximum value I can generate here considering all constraints ....

2. direction of travel 
   - Left to right  : left side value is 0

3. Travel and solve
   - until 5 we can make maxumim value as 0
   -  if you are at position `n`
       - if there is no board : carry forward the last value 
       - if there is a board 
             - Calculate the total value so far if we consider teh baord 
                    - Calculate the value of board at `n` = X
                    - Calculate the value if board at `n-3` [ assuming 3 is teh constraint distance] = Y
                    - total value so far  X+ Y

             - Calculate the total value so far if we do not consider teh baord 
                    - value at `n-1` = Z 
             - take teh max of `Z`, `X+Y`


 - Value at 0 to 5 
    -    0 
-   value at : 6
    - there is a board 
    - value so far if we take the board : 5
    - value so far if we do not take the baord: 0
    - Max ( 5 , 0)  : 5

-   value at : 7
    - Carried : 5   
-   value at : 8
    -  if we do not take the board : value so far 5
    -  if we take the baord 
          -  Value at current location : 8
          -  Value at 5th location : 0
          -  Total = 8+0 = 8
    -  Final val: Max( 8,5) = 8

-   value at : 12 [ interesting case] 
    -   if we do not take the board : value so far 8
    -   if we take the baord 
          -  Value at current location : 5
          -  Value at 12 - 3 = 9th location : 8
          -  Total = 8+5 = 13
    -  Final val: Max( 13,5) = 13
