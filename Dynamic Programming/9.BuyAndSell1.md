# Buy and sell Shares ( simple)
1. You are given a number n, representing the number of days.
2. You are given n numbers, where ith number represents price of stock on ith day.
3. You are required to print the maximum profit you can make if you are allowed a single transaction.


You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**
````
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
````
**Example 2:**
````
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
````



## Strategy 
- Storage and Meaning 
  - what is the profit we can make if we sell on `i`th day
  
- Direction 
  - left to right 
- Travel and Solve 
  - on every move calculate the min value so far
  - based on the min value calculate what profit we make if we sell on `i`th day 
  - capture if is teh more than the max profit value
