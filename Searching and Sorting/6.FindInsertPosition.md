# Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.


Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
````
Output: 2
````
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
````
Example 3:
````
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
````

## Leetcode
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/

## Point to Note 
1. The final index position is `left` ; why so ????
````
    return left  ; 
````

2. Cosnider teh following condition ; we want to insert 1
````
array[] = [2]
l = 0
h = 0
m = 0 

````
- Since 1< arr[m] , we reduce teh high pointer ; but teh low stays in correct position 
````
h = -1
````
## Code
````java
public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        
        
        int left = 0 ;
        int right = nums.length-1;
        
        int mid = 0 ;
        while(left<=right){
            
            mid = left + (right - left) /2 ;
            
            if(nums[mid] == target)
                return mid ;
            
            else if( nums[mid] < target)
                left = mid+1 ;
            else 
                right = mid-1;
        }
            
           return left  ; 
        
        
        
    }
