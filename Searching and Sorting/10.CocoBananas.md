# Coco Eating bananas
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4

## Strategy

1. Points
   - we need to find the rate of eating `k` so taht the pile of  banana can be finished in `h` hours 
   - each array element denotes the no of bananas in pile 
   - coco can eat from 1 pile ; if finished early she can not move to next pile 
      - for example ; if the pile contains '5' bananas and rate of eating is `3` coco needs '2' hours
        ````
        calculation :
          if(pilesize <= rate)
            hour = 1
          if(pilesize > rate)
            hour =   pilesize/ rate + 1 ; 

        // thsi 1 hour is for the remaining bananas of teh pile

        ````
2.  Technically the rate can be from 1 till Max(pilesize) ; this means ; if teh pile array is `[3,6,7,11]` then the probable rate array is `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]`
3. We shall pick each element and calculate the hours(`h`) it take;   
4. We shall pick the midle element in array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]` and using we shal calculate teh hours`h` ; if the time is less than expected we need to increase teh speed by moving to right else we rechrease the speed by moving left

## Code 

1. We need a method to calculate the hour for  a given speed; 
2. we need binary search to pick teh next speed if teh hours do not match
3. Prerequisite : for binary search sort the array of rate..

````java
class Solution {
    public int rate ;
    public int h ;
    public int[] pilesg ; 
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        // Must be sorted ...
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        int maxVal = piles[piles.length-1] ;
        this.h = h;
        int speedArray[] = new int[maxVal];
        //Initialize the apeedarray 
        // [1,2,3,4,5....., maxspeed]
        for(int i =0 ;i<speedArray.length ;i++){
            speedArray[i] = i+1;
        }
        pilesg = piles;
         binarySearch(speedArray, 0,speedArray.length-1 );
        return rate;
        
    }
    
 boolean binarySearch(int[] speedArray, int low, int high) {

		int mid = 0;
		while (low <= high) {
			mid = low+(high - low) / 2;
			int timetaken = 0;
			timetaken = getHour(pilesg, speedArray[mid]);
			if (timetaken == this.h) {
				this.rate = speedArray[mid];
				return true;
			} else if (timetaken > this.h) {
				// increase teh speed since the expected total hours is more
				low = mid + 1;
			} else {
				// decrease teh speed
				high = mid - 1;
			}

		}

		this.rate = 0;
		return false;
	}

	 int getHour(int[] piles, int speed) {
		int totalTime = 0;

		for (int i : piles) {
            // Time to complete the pile if the 
            // Pile size is greater than speed
			if (i > speed) {
				totalTime = totalTime + (i / speed);
				i = i % speed;
			}
            // Time to finish resisual banana of teh speed more
            // than banana count
			if(i > 0)
				totalTime += 1;

		}

		return totalTime;
