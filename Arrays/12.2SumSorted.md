# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a `1-indexed` array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target `number`. Let these two numbers be numbers`[index1]` and numbers`[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array [`index1, index2] `of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is `exactly one solution`. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only `constant extra space`.

**Example 1:**
````
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
````
**Example 2:**
````
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

#  Strategy
## Major Points
1. the array is `sorted` ; we can use binary search . That will be of complexity `O(nlogn)`
2. We can not use extra space ; space complexity allowd is `O(1)` i.e constant 
3. Array is sorted and only 1 solution possible 
4. We can achieve in `O(n)` time complexity  

- We shall take 2 pointer approach, one pointer pointing at the `front` and one pointer pointing at the `end`
- The sum will be calculated based on the sum of `array[low] + array[high]` 
- since the array is sorted , we can assume 
  - if the sum is more than target, we need to move the right pointer i.e. `high--`
  - if the sum is less , we need to move the left pointer i.e `low++`

- Since we visit each element only once the complexity is `o(n)`
