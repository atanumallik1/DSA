# Longest consecutive sequence 
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

Example 1:
````java
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
````

Example 2:
````java
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

## Approach 

- Constraints 
  - the numbers are not sorted 
  - the numbers contain `-ve`
  - we need to sort in `O(n)`
  - Extra space allowed

- Let us put the numbers in an imaginary number line 
- **Preprocessing** 
  - put the elements in a Set 
  - this takes extra space , allows us to check existence of a number in O(1) -> Constant time 
  - `set.contains(num)`

  - ````java
     Set<Integer> set = new HashSet();  
        //Prepare an Set of the elements 
        for( int num: nums){
            set.add(num);
        }
    ````

- Since we need to find the longest consecutive sequence ; first we need to check whether **a given number in the array is the start of a new sequence**

  - This can be found if teh previous number of a given number is not existing in the set 
  - we can find it in `O(1)`
  - ````java
            if(!set.contains(num-1)){
                 // this is a start of sequence 
                 // if teh previous number is not existing
                 startOfSequence = true; 
             }
             
    ````
- If we hve found teh strat of sequence, what is the length of sequence and is it the max length so far ??
  -  ````java
        if(startOfSequence = true ){
                // if num is teh start of sequence what is the length of this sequence
                int localSequenceCount = 0 ;
                int localNum = num ;
                while(true){
                    if(set.contains(localNum)){
                           //increse the sequence 
                           localSequenceCount++ ;
                           localNum++;
                        }else{
                           // it is end of sequence 
                           break;
                    
                        }
                }
             
                maxSeqCount = Math.max(localSequenceCount,maxSeqCount );
             }
     ````     
    
- handle if no sequence found 
     ````java
          //handle for empty array or no sequence found 
        if( maxSeqCount == Integer.MIN_VALUE )
            maxSeqCount = 0 ;
        
        return maxSeqCount;
