# Sort Colours
Given an array nums with `n` objects colored `red, white, or blue`, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0, 1, and 2 `to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem **without** using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:
````
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
````
Example 2:
````
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
````

## Approach
 - we shall take 3 pointers 
   - high : pointing to right most element 
   - low : pointing to left most element 
   - medium : pointing to left most element  when we start )
   - the `starting state` :

- `Medium` is our running pointer; we take decision based on value of `nums[medium]`
- All elements to the left of `low` are confirmed to be `0`   
- All elements to the right of `high` are confirmed to be `2` 
- all the elements between `low` and `high` are undecided yet (including the pointer positions)

- the `low` pointer moves to right if the element at this position is `0`, and points to the n ext possible candidate 
- the `right` pointer moves to left if the element at this position is `2`, and points to the next possible candidate 
- when all 0 and 2s are sorted, we are left with 1 in the middle

- Loop Condition 
   - the loop terminates when `mid>=high`
   - technically `mid` should stay between `low` and `high` ; when `mid` corsses `high` it is end of loop

## How to Build the Algo 
- `low` : indicates the position which is waiting to get a `0` ; once the position is filled with `0`; `low` can be moved to right and will wait there 

- `high` : indicates the position which is waiting to receive a `2`. The moment this position is filled with `2`, it can move to the left 

- `mid` : Indicates the position who value we want to process ; 
  - if the value is `0` ; we can process it by swapping it with `left` ; once swapped the processing is done , `mid` can move 
  - if the value is `1` ; processing means we leave it at oits positionl ;  mid can move   
  - if the value is `2` : we swap the value of `mid` and `high`; at this moment `mid` get a new value ; we need to process it hence we do not move `mid` hete 

## Code

````java
public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        // indicates the position which needs to be filled with 0
        int low = 0;
        // indicates the position which needs to be filled with 2
        int mid = 0;
        int high = nums.length-1;
        
        int x = 0 ;
        // mid should be less than / eq high 
        // logically : mid is a pointer for 1
        // which will stay before the start of 2, and high is the pointer for 2  
        while(mid<=high){
            // We need to process teh value at mid 
            x = nums[mid];
            
            // Processing 0 ; since we found a 0
            // we need to send it to the right place
            if(x==0){
                // low pointer is at a place where 0 can go
                swap(low, mid , nums);
                // Processing done 

                // Low should wait at the next possible location for 0
                low++;
                // mid should look for next numberv to be procesed
                mid++;
            }
            // Processing for 1
            else if(x==1){

            else{
                // high pointer is at a place where 2 can go
                // send this at the right place 
                 swap(mid, high , nums);

                 // High pointer to move at a place
                 // whete the next 2 may go.. 
                 high--;

                 // here mid gets a new value ; which is unprocessed ; so we do not move mid
            }
            
        }
        
    }
