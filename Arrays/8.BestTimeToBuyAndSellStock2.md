# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 
````
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

````
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
````
````
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

## Strategy
### Approach 

0. We need to identify every upstroke ; every upstroke is an opportunity to gain profit .We need to collect the profit.If we Buy once at the lowest and sell once at the highest peak then the profit is less. In the Picture bewlo you can understand...

Note: You can see from teh previous and next picture, the profit is same if we break the transactions .. 
````
Buy at 2, sell at 6 --> Profit is 4
But at 2, Sell at 3, Buy at 3 , Sell at 6 --> Profit is 4

1. We Identify the local Peaks, at this point we **sell** it assuming we had already bought it in teh dip ..

````java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] a) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i< a.length ;i ++){
            if(a[i] > a[i-1])
            {   
                // When A[i] > A[i-1]; it is a ocal Peak so we can sell here assumed that we had purchased before 
                profit += a[i] - a[i-1] ;
            }      
        }
        return profit;   
    }
}

### Approach 2
based on the above description another little variantion possible 

1. at the beginning ; `buyDate`,`sellDate` at index 0
````
buyDate;sellDate = 0
````
2. in every Peak we move teh Sale Date 
````
if a[i] > a[i-1]
  sellDate ++;
````
3. In everyDip , we book profit and re initialize `buyDate`,`sellDate`

````
else 
    profit += a[sellDate] - a[buyDate];
    buyDate = sellDate = i ;
````
4. Explicitly we need to handle teh last price increase . This is important since we collect in every dip ; if the last path is a hill , then the collection isnot happening in teh loop ; 

````
 //We need to settle the last increase seperately 
        
        profit += a[saleDate] - a[buyDate];
        return profit;
````

            if(a[i] > a[i-1])
            {   
                // the price is increased, move the saleDate
                saleDate++;
            }else{
                //book ptofit 
               profit += a[saleDate] - a[buyDate];
                // Reinitialize buydate and saledate 
                buyDate = i ;
                saleDate = i;
            }
               
        }
        //We need to settle the last increase seperately

        return profit;

Note: 
This last profit is collected explicitly

If teh last leg is a valley ; no need to collect since both buyDate/SaleDate are at teh sameplace
