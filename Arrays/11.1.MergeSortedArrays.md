# Merge 2 Sorted Arrays   

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

````
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

## Strategy
### Approach 1 ( best)
0. __Point to Note__ : 
    -  The first array is the target attary. Which means the first array had `m` number of empty spaces in the end where `m` is the number of elements in Second Array .
    -  The arrays are sorted, so we need to take advantage of this fact 
1. The first array has empty space to contain the result ; this means we do not eed any extra space , we can use first array to store the sorted result


2. We can pick the last elements from both the arrays ; the biggest will go to the last available spot in the target array 

3. Spillover handling 
    -  Since `Array1` is the target array , we need to do spillover handling only for `Array2`.  You can do this in an example  walkthough 
    - Spillover from `Array2` can happen in the ollowing 2 cases

    - In all other cases there is no spill over

## Code
````java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
     int k = m+n-1 ;
     int i = m-1;
     int j = n-1 ;
        
     // Copy elements from both the arrays  ; take 2 pointers pointing at the end , compare and put teh biggest at the end 
     while( i >=0 && j>= 0){
         if(nums1[i] >= nums2[j]){
             nums1[k] = nums1[i];
             i--;
         }else {
             nums1[k] = nums2[j];
             j--;
         }
         k--;
       } 
     
     //   Spillover handlig : only if any element is spilled over in second array we need to copy them in first array 
      // Since array 1 is the target array we do not need to do spill over handling fro first array    
     while(j >=0){
          nums1[k] = nums2[j];
             j--;
             k--;
     }   
    }
