#   Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:
````
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
````
Example 2:
````
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
````
Example 3:
````
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

## Leetcode
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/ 

## Approach 
1. First we create a frequency Map for the characters 
````java
 char[] wordAsCharArr =   s.toCharArray();
	      //Create a frequency map   
	      Map<Character,Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<Character,Integer>();  
	      for(char c:wordAsCharArr )  {
	          freqMap.put( c,  freqMap.getOrDefault(c,0) +1 );
	      }
````

2. Now map this information into a different array where the index of array represents the frequency of the chatacted in teh array

3. Array is naturally soretd by index . Here we  traverse from the back and identify the characters based on descending order of frequency . We generate the final string

4. This approach saves us from Sorting the characters. Complexity is `O(n)`

## Code

````java
  public String frequencySort(String s) {
	        
	      char[] wordAsCharArr =   s.toCharArray();
	      //Create a frequency map   
	      Map<Character,Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<Character,Integer>();  
	      for(char c:wordAsCharArr )  {
	          freqMap.put( c,  freqMap.getOrDefault(c,0) +1 );
	      }
	      
	        
	       Set<Character> freqArr[]  = new Set[s.length() + 1];
	       Set<Character> charSet = null; 
	       for( Map.Entry<Character,Integer> entry: freqMap.entrySet()){
	           
	           if( freqArr[entry.getValue()]== null){
	               freqArr[entry.getValue()] = new HashSet<Character>();
	           }
	           
	           freqArr[entry.getValue()].add(entry.getKey());
	       }
	       
	       StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); 
	        
	       for( int i = freqArr.length-1 ; i>=1 ; i--){
	           if(freqArr[i] != null){
	             //Process the result; 
	             for( char temp :  freqArr[i] )
	            	 // temp character is present i times 
	            	 for(int j = i ; j >0; j--)
	                   sb.append(temp);
	               
	           }
	           
	       } 
	      return sb.toString();
	        
	    }
