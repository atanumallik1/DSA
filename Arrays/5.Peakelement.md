# Find Peak 
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
````
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

- Constraint 
  - You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.  
  - This makes this problem hard  

# Ordinary Solution 

 Complexity O(n)

````java
 public int findPeakElement(int[] a) {
        int low = 0 ;
        int high = 0 ;
        for(int i = 1; i< a.length ; i++){
            
            
            if(a[i] >= a[i-1]){
                low = i;
                high = i;
            }
            
            else {
                low = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if(low != high)
                return high;
        
        return -1 ;
    }

## Strategy 
1. Take mid element 
2. If mid is a Peak , exit 
   - Condition to Check if Mid is a Peak : Left Condition and Right Condition 
   - Left Condition 
     - if the index = 0 || a[mid] >= a[mid-1]
   - Right Condition 
     - if the index = n-1 || a[mid] >= a[mid+1]
3. Else move to the subarray which is having bigger element . 

````java
class Solution {
    
    public int findPeakElement(int[] a) {
            int low = 0 ;
            int high = a.length -1; 
            int mid; 
        
             while(low <= high){
             mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
                 
             // condition to check if a[mid] is a peak 
             
              if((mid == 0 || a[mid] >= a[mid-1] ) &&
                 (mid == a.length -1 ||a[mid] >= a[mid + 1] ))
                  return mid; 
                 
              // if mid is not a peak
              // move to the side which has bigger element than mid; this is because at some point the bigger element might become the peak 
               if(a[mid + 1] > a[mid ])
                   low = mid + 1;
               else 
                   high = mid -1 ;
                 
                           
                 
                 
             }
        
        return -1 ;
    }
