# Find Mid  

Find Middle of a linked List

**Example 1:**
````
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
````
**Example 2:**
````
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

## Strategy
1. Use `fast` and `slow` pointers ,where `fast` moves at athe double speed of `slow`
2. the where condition in while loop 
  - we want to move at 2X speed using following code 
    ````
    fast = fast.next.next ;
    ````
  - We want fast to move onlt iff there are at least 2 more elements 
   ````java
     while( fast.next!= null && fast.next.next != null){
       //TO-DO
   }
   ````
   
 In most of the cases following condition will alos work ; 
  ````
  while( fast!= null && fast.next != null){}
  ````
  but teh above  condition produces wrong result if there are only 2 item in the list

  So always remember this  **We want fast to move onlt iff there are at least 2 more elements**
   
   
4. Which pointer points to the mid node
  - It is the slow pointer which points to the mid node
  - Whether the list has  even or odd nodes; slow pointer points to the mid node

## Code
````java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head ;
        ListNode slow = head; 
        // Move fast only if there are at least 2 next elements 
        while( fast.next!= null && fast.next.next != null){
            
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
}
