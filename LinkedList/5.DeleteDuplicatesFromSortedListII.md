#  Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
 
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

## Strategy
1. We do not want any new space / copy etc 
2. `Set up` :   we need to set up few pointers and their responsibilities 
 - `dummyHead` -->  sentinal node , dummy head 
 - `iterator` --> running node for the `target` list  ; iterator will contain value which is eligible to be put in the final list ; i.e. non duplicate values 
 - `iterator.next` -->  points to a `probable` candidate 
    -  if it is a `valid` value  then we move the iterator by doing  `iterator = iterator.next`
    -  else we assign a new node to `iterator.next` 
 - `current` --> running node for the source list  , this is always ahead of `iterator.next`

 with this setup we are ready to process 
 at the end of setup we are

 3. Processing  : while `current!=null`
   - run an `innerloop` and pass all elements where `current.val == itr.next.val` , here we are excluding all elements which are duplicate 
   - if thsi loop runs then `itr.next` was containing a duplicate , so we replace it ` itr.next = current ;`
   - if the loop did not run then `itr.next` was containing a non-  duplicate, we move `itr` one step further...
