# Cycle Detection of Linked list and identifying cycle start point 

Find if a cycle exist in a link list 
- We need 2 pointers  ; one `first` pointer and one `slow` pointer

### Note 
-  Important formula `x = kl - y`
    - `k` speed of `fast` pointer / speed of `slow` pointer  i.e the ratio of speed between `fast` and `slow` pointer
    - `x` length of tail 
    - `y` length of meeting point within cycle  
-  what ratio is good 
   - `k` needs to be greater than 1 ; if `k=1` then every node is a meeting node ; our algo will fail 
   -  ratio 2 is optimum , that meand one pointer runs at speed `x`, other runs at speed `2x`
   -  if teh ratio is more than 2, like 3,4,5,6... , the cycle detection time will increase , i.e. within the circle the pointers will cover circle multiple times before meeting 

## Identify Cycle 
- initialize 2 pointers
- one moves 1 step at a time ; other moves 2 steps at a time 
- after movement, if nodes are same then they meet within the cycle , and this is teh meeting point within the cycle

#### Note
- Check the exit condition in the loop ; this is same like finding mid

````java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        
        if(head == null || head.next == null)
            return false ;
        
        ListNode fast = head ;
        ListNode slow = head;
        
        while(fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            
            if(fast == slow)
                return true;    
        }
        return false;        
    }
}
````


## Identify cycle start  point 

### Strategy 
1. Prerequisite : Identify cycle by using `fast` and `slow` pointers ... bothe meet at the meeting point 
2. once the meeting point is reached
   - reset the slow pointer to `head`
   - reset the speed of `fast` pointer  to 1x
   - move both in another loop , they meet at the cycle starting point

#### Why this work
  - from the meeting point the distance to reach the cycle start point is same as the distance from head

````java
public class Solution {
   public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        
        if(head== null || head.next == null) 
            return null ;//no cycle 
        
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head ;
        boolean cycleDetected = false;
        while(fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            fast=fast.next.next ;
            slow=slow.next ;
            
            if(fast == slow){
                cycleDetected = true ;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if(cycleDetected){
            //reset start
            slow = head;
            while(slow != fast)
            {
                slow = slow.next ;
                fast = fast.next ;
            }
            return slow;
            
        }
        
        return null ;
        
    } 
}
