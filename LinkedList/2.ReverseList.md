## Strategy
## Approach 1 : Iterative
1. We need to think how many pointers do we need.. 
2. We need one as `current` and we need one to represent `previous`. The back link is established using 
````java
current.next = previous; 
```` 

3. Now think about the following picture , where the back link is established bu teh next element is missing..

4. Here we need another pointer `forward` who will always point to the next element

## Code
````java
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        
        ListNode current = head;
        ListNode forward = null;
        ListNode previous = null ;
        
        while(current!= null){  
            forward = current.next ; //back up
            current.next = previous; 
            previous = current ;
            current = forward;
            
        }
        // This is the new Head
        return previous; 
        
    }
}
````
Note 
1. Note that `previous` will point to the head of teh new list
