#  Intersection of Two Linked Lists  

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

# Strategy
## Approach 1 : Map
1. Traverse teh first list and add items to Map 
2. Traverse teh second list and check if the item is already available in teh first list by reading map 
- Needs extra space 

## Approach 2 : 
- Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4aqNarb0QQ 
- no extra space 

- Calculate teh leangth of both lists 
- calculate the difference (`K`)
- move the large list head by `K` steps 
- now mobe both the heads together; they will go to same node if there is an intersection point
