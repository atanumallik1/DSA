# Merge 2 Sorted Linked List    

Description of problem

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

## Strategy
1. `Dummy Node` 
   - We create a `DummyNode` , this is a popular practice 
   - We create a `tail` variable pointing to thsi dummy node  
   - This represents the new merged List; while returning the new list we need to excldue the dummy. 
   - The new list can be obtained by `dummyNode.next`

2. Add new nodes to our new list 
   - `tail` pointer is currently pointing to the `DummyNode`
   - We can add new nodes via the `tail` pointer ; comparing both the other pointers
   -  Add the next element 
        - `tail.next = L1` 
   - move the tail to the next element of the new list
        - `tail = tail.next ;`
   - move the pointer in the list (from which we consumed the element )to the next 
        - `L1=L1.next`
3. Add the unprocessed nodes to teh `tail`

4. Finally drop the `DummyNode`



## General Concepts 
### Linked List element addition 
1. `tail` should point to the last element of the list 
2. `newElement` is added by adding an element as `next` element of `tail`
````java
tail.next = newElement; 
```` 
3. Due to this addition `tail` is no more teh last element; we need to advance `tail` to teh last element by doing 
````java
tail = tail.next; 
```` 

## Code
````java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode tail = dummy ;
        
        while (list1 != null && list2!= null){
            if(list1.val < list2.val){
                tail.next = list1;
                tail = list1;
                
                list1 = list1.next ;
        
            }else{
                tail.next = list2;
                tail = list2;
                
                list2 = list2.next ;
            }
        }
        
        if(list2 != null)
            tail.next = list2;
        
         if(list1 != null)
            tail.next = list1;
        
        return dummy.next ;   
    }
}
