# Move zeros to Right 
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

## Explanation 

- we shall use 2 pointers `L` and `R`
- `R` will move with every iteration of loop 
- `L` waits at a `0`
-  if `arr[R] !=0` , we `swap L and R`  and increase `L`


- Another way of looking into this algo
    - we start with `L` and `R` pointing to first element of array 
    - `R` is our frontier; we take decision based on value at `R`
    - if `arr[R] != 0`; we swap `L and R` and move both else we move only `R`
    - this way we do some extra swaps ; for example: if teh array is like below it will do 4 swaps even though there are no `0`
