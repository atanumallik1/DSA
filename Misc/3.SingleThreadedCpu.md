# Single thread CPU 

You are given `n`​​​​​​ tasks labeled from `0 to n - 1` represented by a `2D` integer array tasks, where tasks`[i] = [enqueueTime i, processingTime i]` means that the i​​​​​​th​​​​ task will be available to process at enqueueTimei and will take processingTimei to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:

- If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
- If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the shortest processing time. **If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.**
- Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
- The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.
- Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

 

Example 1:
````
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]
Output: [0,2,3,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows: 
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
Example 2:

Input: tasks = [[7,10],[7,12],[7,5],[7,4],[7,2]]
Output: [4,3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows:
- At time = 7, all the tasks become available. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3,4}.
- Also at time = 7, the idle CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3}.
- At time = 9, the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks = {0,1,2}.
- At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 2. Available tasks = {0,1}.
- At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 28, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.

## Leetcode

## Video 
- neetcode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR1n-d4oYqE 

## Approach
 - Understand the `Task Definition`
  - `[i] = [enqueueTime i, processingTime i]`  means tehtask is submitted at `enqueueTime i` and it takes `processingTime i` to finish 
  - For example Task `[1,2]` means the task starts at time `1` and it takes `2` units of time 
  - Task array is represented by `tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]` ; 
      - where `tasks[i][0]` : task submit time 
      - where `tasks[i][1]` : task duration time 
- Understanding the result structure 
  - the index of the task we need to return 
  - for example task `[1,2]` start first  index `0`
  - next task `[3,2]` is picked up next index `2` and so one 
  - so the result is `[0,2,....]`


- First step : introduce the original index 
  - since we need to return teh original `index` of the tasks ; we need to introduce the original index along with the tasks 
    ````java
        // Create another array to also contain the OriginalIndex
		Integer[][] tasks = new Integer[tasksOuter.length][tasksOuter[0].length + 1];
		// Task : t[x][0] : Entry Time
		// Task : t[x][1] : Duration of Task to Run
		// Task : t[x][2] : Original Index of Element
		for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
			tasks[i][0] = tasksOuter[i][0];
			tasks[i][1] = tasksOuter[i][1];
			tasks[i][2] = i; //introduce index
		}
    ````
  - Sort the array based on entry time 
   - we need a comparator here which is sorting based on entry time 

   ````java
    class ArrayComparator implements Comparator<Integer[]> {

	@Override
	public int compare(Integer[] o1, Integer[] o2) {
        // Task : t[x][0] : Entry Time
		// Task : t[x][1] : Duration of Task to Run
		// Task : t[x][2] : Original Index of Element
		Integer aa = o1[0];   
		Integer ab = o2[0];
		return aa - ab;
	   }
      }
   ````
   ````java

		// Sort the array based on entry time : t[x][0]
		// The first task to appear is now at the beginning
		Arrays.sort(tasks, new ArrayComparator());

   ````
   - now the first task in teh array  is teh first task submitted as per time axis

- now we need to keep the tasks in a `priority queue`; here the task with lowest duration gets teh highest priority to be picked 
   - we need to create a comparator to be used in the `PriorityQueue`; the comparing key is teh `duration`
   - The following code does not cover the followibg coparator condition ( but can be easily implemented)
   	   -  **If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.** 	
   ````java
   class QueueComparator implements Comparator<Integer[]> {

	@Override
	public int compare(Integer[] o1, Integer[] o2) {
        // Task : t[x][0] : Entry Time
		// Task : t[x][1] : Duration of Task to Run
		// Task : t[x][2] : Original Index of Element
		// Compare based on duration of task
		Integer aa = o1[1];
		Integer ab = o2[1];
		return aa - ab;
	}

    }
   ````
   
   - now we can create teh `PriorityQueue`
   
   ````java
   PriorityQueue<Integer[]> pqueue = new PriorityQueue<Integer[]>(new QueueComparator());

   ````
- Processing 
  - We start with putting the firt element in `PriorityQueue`
  - while  `PriorityQueue` is not empty 
     - we pop the element ; this means the element is processed ; we capture teh index 
     - we calculate the `start` and `end time` of this task
     - we put all the other tasks in the queue whose start time is between `start` and `end` time of the current task

     ````java
     // Add the first element in the queue to be processed first
		pqueue.add(tasks[0]);
		int starttimeWhenTaskIsPicked = tasks[0][0];
		int endtimeWhenTaskEnds = tasks[0][0];;

		int[] finalResultOrder = new int[tasksOuter.length];
		int index = 0;
		while (!pqueue.isEmpty()) {
			Integer[] temp = pqueue.remove();
			int originalIndexOfCurrentElement = temp[2];
			int durationOfCurrentElement = temp[1];
			//int entryTimeOfCurrentElement = temp[0];
            
			starttimeWhenTaskIsPicked = endtimeWhenTaskEnds;
			finalResultOrder[index++] = originalIndexOfCurrentElement;
			endtimeWhenTaskEnds += durationOfCurrentElement;

			for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
				if (tasks[i][0] > starttimeWhenTaskIsPicked && tasks[i][0] <= endtimeWhenTaskEnds)
				pqueue.add(tasks[i]);

			}

		}

`Note` : Almost works

		Integer aa = o1[0];
		Integer ab = o2[0];

		if (o1[0] == o2[0])
			return o1[1] - o2[1];
		return aa - ab;
	}

}
class QueueComparator implements Comparator<Integer[]> {
	@Override
	public int compare(Integer[] o1, Integer[] o2) {
		// Compare based on duration of task
		Integer aa = o1[1];
		Integer ab = o2[1];
		return aa - ab;
	}
}
class Solution {
    public int[] getOrder(int[][] tasksOuter) {
		
		 

		if (tasksOuter == null || tasksOuter.length == 0)
			return null;

		// Create another array to also contain the OriginalIndex
		Integer[][] tasks = new Integer[tasksOuter.length][tasksOuter[0].length + 1];

		// Task : t[x][0] : Entry Time
		// Task : t[x][1] : Duration of Task to Run
		// Task : t[x][2] : Original Index of Element

		for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
			tasks[i][0] = tasksOuter[i][0];
			tasks[i][1] = tasksOuter[i][1];
			tasks[i][2] = i;
		}

		// Sort the array based on entry time : t[x][0]
		// The first task to appear is now at the beginning
		Arrays.sort(tasks, new ArrayComparator());

		PriorityQueue<Integer[]> pqueue = new PriorityQueue<Integer[]>(new QueueComparator());

		// Add the first element in the queue to be processed first
		pqueue.add(tasks[0]);

		int endtimeWhenTaskEnds = tasks[0][0];;

		int[] finalResultOrder = new int[tasksOuter.length];

		while (!pqueue.isEmpty()) {
			Integer[] temp = pqueue.remove();
			int originalIndexOfCurrentElement = temp[2];

			starttimeWhenTaskIsPicked = endtimeWhenTaskEnds;
			finalResultOrder[index++] = originalIndexOfCurrentElement;
			endtimeWhenTaskEnds += durationOfCurrentElement;

- BUG
  -  this code doesm not stop already processed elements...
