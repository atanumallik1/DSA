# Reorder Log Content
You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

- Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
- Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:

- The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
- The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
- The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.


Return the final order of the logs.

Example 1:
````
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
Explanation:
The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".

Example 2:
````
Input: logs = ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]

## Approach 
- We shall use  `Arraus.sort(logs, comparator)`
- The main logic is in the comparator


## Code 

````java
class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        Arrays.sort(logs, new LogComparator());
		 
		return logs;
    }
}

class LogComparator implements Comparator<String> {

	private String[] splitStr(String log) {

        // We want to split in 2 parts : second parameter 2 is used in this method
		return log.split(" ", 2);
	}

	private boolean isNumber(char curChar) {
		return '0' <= curChar && curChar <= '9';
	}

	@Override
	public int compare(String log1, String log2) {
		String[] arr1 = splitStr(log1);
		String[] arr2 = splitStr(log2);

		boolean isNum1 = isNumber(arr1[1].charAt(0));
		boolean isNum2 = isNumber(arr2[1].charAt(0));


        // If both are numbers then maintain their relative position
        // the following code does that 
        // if we return 0 ; the relative position is maintained
		if (isNum1 && isNum2)
			return 0;
        // if one of tehm is numberthen we need to place it behind the other one
        // number logs are lexographically behond string logs    
		else if (isNum1)
            // Log1 shold be placed behind Log2
			return 1;
		else if (isNum2)
            // Log 1 will be placed before Log2 
			return -1;

        // both are string as ode came here    
		boolean isSameContent = arr1[1].equals(arr2[1]);

        // If the content is sme sort based on ID of the log whihc is at index 0 of the splitted array
		if (isSameContent)
			return arr1[0].compareTo(arr2[0]);

        // if the content is not same ; compare based on teh split value    
		return arr1[1].compareTo(arr2[1]);
	}

}
