# Valid Parentheses String
Given a string s containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', return true if s is valid.

The following rules define a valid string:

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "(*)"
Output: true
````
````
Example 3:

Input: s = "(*))"
Output: true

## Explanation Strategy
- `*` can be considered as `(`,`)` or ` `.
- The position of `*` is significant ; it is important to identify that due to the placement of `*` the stacks are not balanced
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/178775875-6c9a6dc5-126a-4ce8-b4c9-eed7d904668d.png)

- We need to create 2 `stacks` which will contain the `index` of `(` or `*`
  - `parentheses_start_index_stack` : will hold the index of left parentheses
  - `star_index_stack`  : will hold the index of `*`

- There are 2 parts of the algorithm
  - balancing `)` parentheses : We loop through each character of string, we try to see if all the right parenthses `)` can be  balanced with existing `(` or `*`. If we can not do the answer is **unbalanced**
  -  balancing `(` parentheses : if teh above loop is done, it means the  right parenthses `)` are balanced. We need to check whether the left parentheses  `(` can be balanced ; if they can not be we  the answer is **unbalanced**


-  We travese each character of the string and we try to balance the right parentheses `)`
  - if the character is a `(` , push it into `parentheses_start_index_stack`
  - if the character is a `*` , push it into `star_index_stack` 
  - if the character is a `)` , check if this character can be **balanced**
    - if there a `(` in the `parentheses_start_index_stack` : 
       - if so the `)` is balanced. we can move to next character in string ; 
       - if **not** then go to next condition check ( i.e. stack `*` check )  
    - is there a `*` in `star_index_stack`  
       - does the index of `*` fall before the index of current character `)` , 
          - if yes ; then we can balance the   current character `)` 
          - if no : we **can not balance** ;  End of program
   - end of loop; meaning the `)` are balanced
   
- If the right parenthese `)` are balanced ; we need to check if the left parentheses are also balanced `(`
- for all elements in the stack `parentheses_start_index_stack`
   - pop one `(` from `parentheses_start_index_stack`
   - Is there a `*` whse index is greater than index of `(`
   - if `no` then; we **can not balance** ;  
   - if `yes`, continue 

- if there is still an element left in the `parentheses_start_index_stack` then it is **unbalancd**
