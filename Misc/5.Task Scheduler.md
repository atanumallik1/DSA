# Task Scheduler 

Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

````
Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
````
````
Example 2:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.

Example 3:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A

## Explanation 
- Neetcode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8p8ukTyA2I

## Strategy 
- We need to find the minimum time needed to finish all the tasks 
- Which task to start with 
  - the first question that comes to our mind is we shall start with which task 
  - we should start with the task which is `most frequent` 
  - see the picture 
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/178333532-4ce19b50-98ad-40f7-9419-65a92a8e835c.png)

- Data structures to be used
  - we need a **Max Heap**  .
    - This heap will be used to identify the **max** frequeny
  - we need a **Queue**
    - we shall put some elements in queue which will be blocked until some time due to cool down logic 

- What type of element to be put in **HEap**       
  - We want to put the `frequency` in the heap  
- What type of element to be put in **Queue**  
  - we want to put `remaning frequency` , `activation time` in the queue      

- Main loop 
  - we process until the `queue is empty and the heap is empty`
  - if teh `heap is empty` but the `queue is not empty` ; it means all items which are un teh queue are waiting to be picked up due to cooling period

  - if teh `heap is not empty` but the `queue is   empty` ; it means all we can pick up an item from `heap` and process 

## Code 
````java
class Solution {
 public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {

		Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap();

		// Identify Each Character and its frequency
		for (char c : tasks) {
			map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
		}

		// Max Heap of frequency
		PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue(new MaxComparator());
		Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList();

		// Fill teh heap with Frequency numbers
		for (Map.Entry entry : map.entrySet()) {
			maxHeap.add((Integer) entry.getValue());
		}

		int timeTaken = 0;
		int maxFreqElement = 0;
		int queueEntry[];

		while (!maxHeap.isEmpty() || !queue.isEmpty()) {
			if (maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
				timeTaken = timeTaken + 1;
			} else {
				
				
				maxFreqElement = maxHeap.remove();
				maxFreqElement--;
				timeTaken = timeTaken + 1;
				// Put the element in queue so that it blocked until teh target time
				if (maxFreqElement > 0) {
					queueEntry = new int[2];
					// remaining Requency
					queueEntry[0] = maxFreqElement;
					// until what time it should be idle
					queueEntry[1] = timeTaken + n;

					queue.offer(queueEntry);
				}

			}

			// Take elements out of the queue and put in heap whose targetTime has arrived
			int startTime = 0;
			int frequencyRemaining;

			while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
				queueEntry = queue.peek();
				frequencyRemaining = queueEntry[0];
				startTime = queueEntry[1];
				if (timeTaken >= startTime) {
					// Remove from queue
					queue.poll();
					maxHeap.add((Integer) frequencyRemaining);
				} else {
                    // no more element in queue whose time has arrived
					break;
				}
			}

		}

		return timeTaken;

	}
}

class MaxComparator implements Comparator<Integer> {
	public int compare(Integer a, Integer b) {
		return (a - b) * -1;
	}

}
