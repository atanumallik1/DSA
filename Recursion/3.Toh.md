public class TohTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		toh(3, 'A', 'C', 'B');
	}

	public static void toh(int plates, char from, char to, char mid) {
	    
	    // recusrsion if the number of disks are more than 0
	    if(plates > 0) {	
		
		toh(plates - 1, from, mid, to);
		System.out.println("Disk "+ plates +" moved from "+from+" to "+to);
		toh(plates - 1, mid, to, from);
	    }
	    else return ;
	}
