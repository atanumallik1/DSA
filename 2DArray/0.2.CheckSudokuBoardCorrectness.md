# Valid Sudoku Board

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 

**Example 1:**
````
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
````
**Example 2:**
````
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

## Strategy

- `Conditions` :  A valid Sudoku Board should Satisfy the following : every `cell` shoud satisfy the following conditions
  - Row Condition : number in the cell is unique in the row
  - Column Condition : number in the cell is unique in the column
  - Box Condition   : number in the cell is unique in the box

- `Deduce a Box from a Cell`
  - we need to devide the Sudoku board `9X9` into 9 `3X3` smaller boxes
  - given a cell `= a[i,j]` We should be able to tell which box it belongs to 
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/167288924-24db5895-2b08-4e66-81f8-8c30574ff96c.png)

  - We can devide the i,j value by 3 to deduce the final box. For example `cell[3][3]` maps to `box[1][1]`

  - This is very important step 

- `Knowledge Buildinng `
  ````java
   Set<String> knowledge = new HashSet();
  ````
 - For every cell we visit we want to buld 3 information in the set 
   - RowInfo :  We want to add a value with Key `ROW-ROWINDEX-VALUE`in the `set`
   - ColumnInfo:We want to add a value with Key `COL-COLINDEX-VALUE` in the `set`
   - BoxInfo:We want to add a value with Key `BOX-ROWINDEX/3-COLINDEX/3-VALUE` in the `set`
 
   - so, if `cell[3][3]=5`; this will contribute following data to knowledge `set` 
     - ROWS-2-5
     - COLS-2-5
     - BOX-1-1-5

- `Conflict detection` 
  - for evert cell we want to check if there is a row, column , box key in teh set   ; if any match is found then it is not a valid board
