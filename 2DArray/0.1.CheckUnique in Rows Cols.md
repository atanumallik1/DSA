# Check if Every Row and Column Contains All Numbers 

An `n x n` matrix is valid if every row and every column contains all the integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Given an `n x n` integer matrix matrix, return true if the matrix is valid. Otherwise, return false.

**Example 1:**
````
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[3,1,2],[2,3,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: In this case, n = 3, and every row and column contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
Hence, we return true.
````
**Example 2:**
````
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: In this case, n = 3, but the first row and the first column do not contain the numbers 2 or 3.
Hence, we return false.

## Strategy

- We need to answer the question if all Rows/Columns contain any duplicate number ?

- When we are at a certain cell , we want to see if the value in the cell dupicates `row wise` or `columm wise`
- For example: if we are at cell [2][3], and `a[2][3] = 5` we want to check if 5 exists 
   - Row wise 
   - Column wise

- if any duplicate is found we can exit ...
- should we prepare the knowledge beforehand or should we process on teh go? 
   -  Look at the picture below 
   -  If we are at cell `a[0][3]`, we can not yet tell that there is a conflicting element at `a[0][7]`, since both has value `1`
   -   If we are at cell `a[0][3]`, we can not yet tell that there is a conflicting element at `a[3][3]`, since both has value `7`
   -   but when we are at cell `a[0][7]` weshall certainly find the the conflict since we already had teh knowledge of `a[0][3]`. Same for cell `a[3][3]`
   -   So teh summary is we do not need to prepopulate the whole knowledge prapg, we can process each element and process the knowledge

- Conflict detection 
  - we want to ask teh question : does number `x` exist anywhere in the same row , does number `x` exist anywhere in the same column   
  - We want to build knowlege `row` data and `column` data 
  - We need a `Set` we can store 2 types of values 
    -  Row Values :  with Key `ROW-ROWINDEX-VALUE` 
    -  Column Values :  with Key `ROW-ROWINDEX-VALUE`
 With thsi knowledge we can answer whether a value is previously encountered in the Row/column

 - The check can be done in constant timeusing 
 ````java
  Set<String> knowledge = new HashSet();
  knowledge.contains("row-"+i+a[i][j])
 ````
# Code
````java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValid(int[][] a) {
        
        int length = a[0].length ;
        Set<String> knowledge = new HashSet();
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i<=length-1 ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j<=length-1 ; j++){
            
              //Identify if there is a duplicate based on knowledge so far 
                if(knowledge.contains("row-"+i+"-" +a[i][j]) ||  knowledge.contains("col-"+j+"-" +a[i][j])){
                    return false ;
                }
                
              //Build Knowledge 
              knowledge.add("row-"+i+"-" +a[i][j]);  
              knowledge.add("col-"+j+"-" +a[i][j]);  
                
    
    }
        
}
      
        return true ;
    }
