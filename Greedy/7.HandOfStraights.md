# 846. Hand of Straights
Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array hand where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]

Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.

## Leetcode 
https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/submissions/

##  Explanation 
- Neetcode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amnrMCVd2YI&t=347s

## Approach 
- We use a `Min Heap` to get the lowest number and we need a `Frequency map`
- We `peek` the min element from Heap and check if we can get  enough frequency in the frequency map to take next `k` elements 

## Code 

 ````java
 class Solution {
    public boolean isNStraightHand(int[] hand, int groupSize) {
        // Key   = Card
        // Value = Freq
        Map<Integer,Integer> frequency = new HashMap();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minheap = new PriorityQueue();
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < hand.length ; i++){
            frequency.put(hand[i], frequency.getOrDefault(hand[i], 0)+1);
            if(!minheap.contains(hand[i])){
                minheap.add(hand[i]);
            }
        }
        
        int topElement= 0; 
        Integer topFrequency = 0 ;
        int elementCount = 0 ;
        
        
        while(!minheap.isEmpty()){
           topElement = minheap.peek();
           
            for(int i = 0 ;i < groupSize; i++){
               topFrequency = frequency.get(topElement) ;
               if(topFrequency == null)
                   // next consecutive element could not be found within a group
                   return false;
                
               topFrequency--;
                

                if( topFrequency == 0)   {
                  minheap.remove();
                  frequency.remove(topElement);
                }else{
                  frequency.put(topElement, topFrequency);
                 }
                // we have taken an element into the group
                elementCount++;

                topElement++;
                // clean up
                topFrequency = null;
               }

                return false;
            }
            
            elementCount = 0 ;
