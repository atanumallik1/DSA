# Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

````
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
````
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

## Explanation

## Approach
- This problem is very easy ; it is a pointer based solution 

- This can be best explaind using the following picture where a portion of the graph ( the first row ) is already connected using teh next pointer. We start from here .We see node `2` and node `3` are already connected. `current` node is pointing at `node 3`.we want to connect the next level.

- We start from `node 2` as `current node` ; we save `nextLevelStart` as the pointer to teh first element of next level 
   - we connect its children using the right pointer `4-> 5`
   - we  use `current->next->left`we connect 5 and 6, 
   - then we move to `node 3` and mark it as `current node`. Then we connect its children `6-->7`.
   - There is **no more** node next to `node 3`

- now we move current to teh next level

## Code 

````java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if(root == null)
            return null;
        Node  current  = root;
        Node  nextLevelStart  = root.left;
        
        while( current!= null &&  nextLevelStart!= null ){
            
            current.left.next = current.right;
            
            if(current.next != null){
                current.right.next = current.next.left;
                current = current.next;
            }else{
                // end of current row
                current = nextLevelStart;
                nextLevelStart = current.left;
            }   
        }       
        return root;
    }
