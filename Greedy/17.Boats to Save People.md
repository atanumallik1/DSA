You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. **Each boat carries at most two people at the same time**, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

## Leetcode
https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/

## Approach 
- Sorting is needed , we sort the array **people**
- after teh array is sorted, the heaviest person is at the end ; the lighest person is at teh front 
- we can take at max 2 persons 
- we take 2 pointers; one for `left` and one for `right`
- if we can take 2 persons, one from `left` and one from `right` of teh array we take a single boat ; we advance teh `left` and the `right` pointers 
- if we can not fit 2 persons ; we take the heaviest and advance teh `right` pointer

## Code
````java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        //sort in ascending Order 
        Arrays.sort(people);
        
        int right = people.length -1 ;
        int left = 0 ;
        int boatCount = 0 ;
        
        while(left <=right ){
            
            // Boat carries at max 2 people 
             if( people[left] + people[right]  <= limit){
                 left ++;
                 right--;
                 boatCount++;
             }else {
                 
                  right--;
                  boatCount++;
             }
        }
        return boatCount;       
    }
}
