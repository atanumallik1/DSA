# Jump Game 1
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's `first` index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.
 
````
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
````
````
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

## Appraoch 
- in each iteration we want to move teh goalpost to the left of teh array
- at the beginning our goal post is at the end : `index : x`
- we want to check if we are at `index : x-1`  ; can we reach the goal post. If yes, we can make index:`x-1` as our goal post ; if not the goal post remains as is 


- we want to reach the `last` element in array from the `first` element; our goalpost is : `last index`
- We shall traverse the array from the end
  - `x` = how many steps are needed from the current element to reach teh end 
  - if the `value of current cell` >= `x` ; it means we can reach the end from the current cell
  - we move our goal post to the current cell

- if the goal post moves to  the start of the array ; it means we can reach the target
