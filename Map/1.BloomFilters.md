# Bloom Filter 

 Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure.

Simple Solusions need to decide between *Memory* and *Running time*.

Specialized Solution will often favour running time

Compression Solution will do the opposite

Probabilistic Data Strictutes takes less memory and offers reasonable querying time , this is done by approximating the answer

## BEhaviour
1. It does not support delete 
2. It can have a little amount of false positive 

## How to implement 

- Use case : we want to catch the users when they try to enter weak passwords. We do not have to be very particular about "WHAT" is the weak password, but if we "feel" it is so we cans top the user 
- so the need is not be precise 
- we need to catch the errors fast and approximation is ok

- we use a bit array ; we mark everything unchecked 
- we set the bit when an entry is inserted
- now we can also get the same bit value, for another key , if we check the map we see the field is already marked , this is a false positive

## Use cases
- Early spell checkerrs
  - due to false positive it may tell that a mispellt word is actually correct  
- keep track of forbidden passwords 
  - add all possible bad passwords in a bloom filter 
  - there can be small false positive but it is fine ..
