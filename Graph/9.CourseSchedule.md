# Schedule Courses 

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array prerequisites where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi first` if you want to take course `ai`.

For example, the `pair [0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.
Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`
