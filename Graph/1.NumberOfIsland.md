# Number of Islands


Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands **horizontally or vertically**. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
````
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
````

Example 2:
````
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

## Approach 
- we can do either by DFS or by BFS
- DFS is easy to implement 

## Code
````java
class Solution {
    Set<String> visited = new HashSet();
    
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int row = grid.length ;
        int col = grid[0].length ;
        int isLandCount = 0 ;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < row ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ;j < col; j++){

                if( grid[i][j]  == '1'){
                    // Is this land part of an already calculated island??
                    if(visited.contains(getKey(i,j)))
                       continue;
                    
                    isLandCount++;
                    bfs(grid, i,j);
                }
                
            }
        }
        
        return isLandCount;

    String getKey(int i , int j){
       StringBuilder sb =  new StringBuilder();
        sb.append(String.valueOf(i));
        sb.append('-');
        sb.append(String.valueOf(j));
        
        return sb.toString();
        
    }
